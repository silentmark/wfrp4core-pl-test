  "Description": "<p>You sweat constantly, your skin exuding a thin, slimy mucous much like that produced by hagfish. This is unpleasant to the touch, soaking through your clothes within an hour or two, and rendering your grip uncertain.</p><p>Any tests that require you to hold anything in your hands (such as a weapon) suffer a -20 penalty, and you also suffer a -20 penalty on appropriate Fellowship tests. When trying to escape a grapple, if you succeed you can choose to either use your rolled SL, or the number rolled on your unitâ€™s die. so, a successful roll of 28 could be used for +8 SL.</p>",
