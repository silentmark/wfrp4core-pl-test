    {
      "Content": "<p>When Combat begins, we zoom into the action. Every Character receives a Turn to do something every Round, using dice to determine who gets hurt, and who doesn’t. You will need to read the @UUID[JournalEntry.XkP5kukwHbjU6NyL.JournalEntryPage.PlIfKND66A2k6Z3p]{Tests Reference Sheet} to understand these rules.</p><h3>Initiative</h3><p>To determine the Turn order, combatants compare their Initiative Characteristics, and act from highest to lowest. Any ties are broken by comparing the Agility Characteristic.</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>The Characters are caught in the midst of a riot, so it’s time to determine who goes first. From highest to lowest, it’s: Amris (I 56), Molrella (I 43), Gunnar (I 34), Salundra (I 32, Agi 33), Ferdinand (I 32, Agi 31), the Brawling Horde (I 30), then Else (I 29) last. Note: any Characters with a Surprised Condition cannot act for the first Round of combat.</em></p><h3>Turns and Rounds</h3><p>You have a Move and an Action on your Turn. These can be taken in any order — it’s presumed you are probably doing both at the same time, and you are encouraged to describe them as one combined manoeuvre. Once every Character has taken a Turn, a new Round begins, and everyone has an opportunity to take another Turn, starting with the Character with the highest Initiative again.</p><h4>Move</h4><p>A Move involves Walking, Charging into Combat, or Running. The GM decides how far you can move on your Turn. As a loose guide, you can move M×2 yards when walking and your M×4 yards when Charging and Running.</p><h4>Action</h4><p>An Action involves figuring out what to do, and then testing a Skill to see if it’s successful. The most common Action in Combat is trying to hit someone with a weapon using WS for Melee or BS for Ranged, but any Skill can be tested on your Turn.</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Else would like to escape the crowded brawl as soon as possible, so the GM tells her Player to attempt a Simple Dodge Test for her Action.</em></p><h3>Fighting</h3><p>When you want to attack an opponent, you perform a <strong>Weapon Skill (WS)</strong> Test (for melee attacks), or <strong>Ballistic Skill (BS)</strong> Test (for ranged attacks) for your Action. Melee attacks are always Opposed Tests, unless the defender has the @ConditionUnconscious] or @Condition[Surprised] Condition. The defender uses their WS or Dodge Skill to oppose the attack. If the Attacker scores more SL than the defender, it’s a successful hit. Ranged attacks are Dramatic but unopposed, and hit if the Character passes the BS Test.</p><p>If an attacker hits, reverse the attack roll (e.g.: a roll of ‘25’ becomes a ‘52’) to determine where on the body the hit landed: 01–09 </p><p>Head, 10–24 Left Arm, 25–44 Right Arm, 45–79 Body, 80–89 Left Leg, or 90–00 Right Leg. The Hit Location is used to see if there is any armour protecting the area.</p><p>The attack deals an amount of Damage equal to the Test’s SL + the Weapon’s Damage + the attacker’s Strength Bonus (for melee attacks). This Damage is reduced by the defender’s Toughness Bonus + the Armour Points on that area of the body. Any excess is subtracted from their Wounds. See the @UUID[JournalEntry.XkP5kukwHbjU6NyL.JournalEntryPage.7h3tPYMgdgDcOJVR]{Injury Reference Sheet} for more on how to handle Wounds, and what happens when Wounds fall to 0!</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Molrella shoots her sling at an Entertainer for her Action, so attempts a Dramatic Ballistic Skill Test. She rolls 13 against her BS of 39. Because it is a ranged attack, the Entertainer cannot defend, so this is not an Opposed Test. Molrella scored +2 SL, and her Sling has +6 Damage, which equals a total of 8 Damage. Molrella reverses the Test roll of 13 for Hit Location, scoring a 31 — right arm! The Entertainer has no Armour on the Right Arm, and Toughness Bonus 3, so loses 5 Wounds (8 − 3 = 5). The Entertainer started with 12 Wounds, but now only has 7 Wounds remaining!</em></p><h3>Advantage</h3><p>Combat has a momentum to it, with success bringing greater feats of glory. In WFRP this is called Advantage, with each Advantage token giving the roller a +10 bonus to all combat Actions. +1 Advantage is gained for each of the following:</p><ul><li><p>Attacking an opponent with the Surprised Condition.</p></li><li><p>Spending your Move Charging headlong into combat.</p></li><li><p>Defeating an important NPC.</p></li><li><p>Winning an Opposed Test during combat.</p></li><li><p>Causing Damage to an opponent without making an Opposed Test.</p></li></ul><p>Characters lose all accrued Advantage if they lose any Opposed Tests or take a Wound.</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Having dodged free of the Riot, Salundra Charges a Jungfreud Agitator harassing Molli for her Move, gaining +1 Advantage. She then uses her Action to attack with her blade, so attempts an Opposed WS Test. She rolls 30 against her WS of 59 (49 + 10 (from the Advantage) = 59), thus scores +2 SL . The Agitator defends, rolling 91 against his WS of 30, thus −6 SL! So, Salundra wins the Opposed Test with +8 SL . Her Sword has +4 Damage, and she has a Strength Bonus of 3, so she has caused 15 Damage (8 + 4 + 3 = 15)! She reverses her Test roll of 30 to determine Hit Location, which is 03 — a head hit. The Agitator has 0 Armour there. So, the blow deals 15 − Armour 0 − Toughness Bonus 3 = 12 Wounds. The Agitator only has 12 Wounds, so it is defeated. Salundra’s player describes the blade whacking off the Agitator’s head, knocking him out cold with a single blow. Triumphant, Salundra gains +1 Advantage for winning an Opposed Test. As she now has 2 Advantage, next Round she will gain a bonus of +20 for her Action.</em></p>",

      "Content": "<p>In games of <strong>WFRP</strong> it is very likely you will be hurt. The following explains the different ways of taking Damage, and how to deal with each.</p><h3>Wounds</h3><p>Every Character has a number of Wounds. Loss of these represents cuts, bruises, and abrasions.</p><p>Wounds are lost whenever you take Damage. Damage is most commonly caused by Combat (refer to the @UUID[JournalEntry.XkP5kukwHbjU6NyL.JournalEntryPage.vRBnsTqZnNwtGt7h]{Combat Reference Sheet} for more on that). Each point of Damage you suffer causes you to lose 1 Wound. So, if you suffer 5 points of Damage, you lose 5 Wounds. Often, especially in combat, your Toughness Bonus and Armour Points can reduce any Damage you suffer.</p><p>If you fall to 0 Wounds, you gain the @Condition[Prone] Condition, which you cannot remove until you return to at least 1 Wound. Worse, if you stay at 0 Wounds for more than Toughness Bonus Rounds, the Prone Condition becomes an @Condition[Unconscious] Condition and you pass out. If you would ever be reduced to negative Wounds, you take a Critical Wound instead.</p><h4>Regaining Wounds</h4><p>To recover your Wounds, you need rest or medical attention. You can attempt an <strong>Average (+20) Endurance</strong> Test after a good sleep once a day, and may heal Wounds equal to the SL + your Toughness Bonus. A Character can also perform a <strong>Challenging (+0) Heal</strong> Test to heal a further SL + Intelligence Bonus Wounds, although each Wound loss can only be treated once per day. You can never have more Wounds than your initial Wound total.</p><h3>Critical Wounds</h3><p>Some blows are so terrible they cause Critical Wounds. These occur in the following circumstances:</p><ul><li><p>If you are reduced to negative Wounds, suffer a Critical Wound instead and set your Wounds to 0.</p></li><li><p>If an opponent rolls a Critical Hit (a double under their WS; ie: 11, 22, and 33 for a WS of 35). Further, you also suffer extra Wounds as detailed in the Crit. Column of the Critical Wound Table.</p></li></ul><p>When a Critical Wound is suffered, roll 1d100 and consult the Critical Wound Table to determine what Critical Wound you suffer and its Effects. If you suffered a Critical Hit, you also suffer the Crit. Column as Damage that is not modified by Toughness Bonus or Armour Points (so, you lose that many extra Wounds). This extra Wound Loss will not lower you below 0 Wounds, so cannot trigger a second Critical Wound.</p><p>If a Character ever suffers more Critical Wounds than their Toughness Bonus whilst having the Unconscious Condition, they die. For minor characters, dropping to 0 Wounds results in death or unconsciousness, as determined by the GM.</p><blockquote class=\"foundry-note\"><p>The Starter Set's Critical Wound Table has been omitted as it is not used in favor of the Core Rulebook's tables</p></blockquote>",

      "Content": "<p><strong>WFRP</strong> uses a selection of Conditions to cover commonly encountered penalties you may face. Each Condition has its own special rules. The Conditions reference the rules found on the @UUID[JournalEntry.XkP5kukwHbjU6NyL.JournalEntryPage.PlIfKND66A2k6Z3p]{Tests Reference Sheet} so it is recommended you read them before reading this sheet.</p><h4>Gaining Conditions</h4><p>The @UUID[JournalEntry.XkP5kukwHbjU6NyL.JournalEntryPage.7h3tPYMgdgDcOJVR]{Injury Reference Sheet} or the GM explain when you receive a Condition. If this happens, you immediately lose all Advantage tokens. Players should mark what Conditions they currently have on a scrap piece of paper.</p><h4>Removing Conditions</h4><p>Each Condition has its own rules for removing it. You can also spend a Resolve point to remove a single Condition.</p><h3>Condition List</h3><p>The following is a list of the Conditions used in the <strong>WFRP Starter Set</strong>.</p><h4>Ablaze</h4><p>You are on fire! At the end of every Round, you suffer [[/r 1d10]] Wounds, modified by Toughness Bonus and the Armour Points on your least protected Hit Location, with a minimum of 1 Wound suffered. Each extra Ablaze Condition you have adds +1 to the Damage suffered; so, if you have 3 Ablaze Conditions, you suffer in 1d10+2 Damage at the end of the Round. One Ablaze Condition can be removed with a successful Dramatic Athletics Test, with each SL removing an extra Ablaze Condition.</p><h4>Bleeding</h4><p>You are bleeding badly. Lose 1 Wound at the end of every Round per Bleeding Condition you have, ignoring all modifiers. One Bleeding Condition can be removed with a successful Dramatic Heal Test, with each SL removing an additional Bleeding Condition. When you remove all Bleeding Conditions, gain a @Condition[Fatigued] Condition.</p><h4>Broken</h4><p>You are fleeing. On your turn, your Move and Action must be used to run away as fast as possible until you are in a good hiding place beyond the sight of any enemy; then you can use your Action on a Skill that allows you to hide more effectively. You also receive a penalty of –10 to all Tests not involving running and hiding. If you are not in combat at the end of a Round, you may attempt a Dramatic Cool Test to remove a Broken Condition, with each SL removing an extra Broken Condition. If you spend a full Round in hiding out of line-of-sight of any enemy, you automatically remove 1 Broken Condition.</p><h4>Fatigued</h4><p>You are very tired and in need of a breather. Suffer a penalty of –10 to all Tests per Fatigued Condition you have, to a maximum of –30. You lose one Fatigued Condition per hour of good rest, preferably in a warm bed.</p><h4>Prone</h4><p>You have fallen to the ground. Your Move can only be used to stand up or crawl at half your Movement in yards. You suffer a 20 penalty to all Tests involving movement of any kind, and any opponent trying to strike you in Melee Combat gains +20 to hit you. You lose all Prone Conditions when you stand up.</p><h4>Stunned</h4><p>You have been disoriented or confused. You are incapable of taking an Action on your Turn, and can only use your Move to stagger at half your normal movement. You also suffer a –10 penalty per Stunned Condition to all Tests, but can defend yourself with Opposed Tests. Any opponent trying to strike you in Melee Combat gains +1 Advantage before rolling the attack. At the end of each Round, you may attempt a Dramatic Endurance Test. If successful, remove a Stunned Condition, with each SL removing an extra Stunned Condition.</p><h4>Surprised</h4><p>You have been caught unawares. You can take no Action or Move and cannot defend yourself in Opposed Tests. The first opponent trying to strike you in Melee Combat gains a bonus of +20 to hit. At the end of the Round, you lose all Surprised Conditions.</p><h4>Unconscious</h4><p>You are knocked out, asleep, helpless, or otherwise insensible. You can do nothing on your Turn and are completely unaware of your surroundings. Any Melee attack targeting you automatically hits as if you had rolled 01 to determine your SL, and also inflicts a Critical Wound. You recover from the Unconscious Condition when you are in a safe location and have time to rest (as determined by the GM).</p>",

      "Content": "<h3>Characteristics</h3><p>The following summarises WFRP’s 10 Characteristics. Each has a number typically ranging from 20–90. These numbers are used by Tests (see the @UUID[JournalEntry.XkP5kukwHbjU6NyL.JournalEntryPage.PlIfKND66A2k6Z3p]{Tests Reference Sheet}).</p><p><strong>Weapon Skill (WS)</strong>: Your skill at fighting hand-to-hand combat.</p><p><strong>Ballistic Skill (BS)</strong>: Your effectiveness at hitting with ranged weapons like bows or pistols.</p><p><strong>Strength (S)</strong>: How strong you are, impacting how much damage you inflict in combat, how much you can lift, and how good you are at activities like swimming and climbing.</p><p><strong>Toughness (T)</strong>: Your endurance. It helps you survive damage in combat but will also help with things like surviving harsh conditions and standing up to poison.</p><p><strong>Initiative (I)</strong>: Speed of thought and reaction, especially in the heat of battle and when under pressure. It determines combat order, and helps you be the first to react to danger. It also determines your powers of intuition and perception.</p><p><strong>Agility (Ag)</strong>: Physical coordination and the basis for things like running, riding, and hiding. Agility is also used for dodging blows in combat.</p><p><strong>Dexterity (Dex)</strong>: Your affinity for performing fine and delicate manual tasks like playing a musical instrument or skilled manufacturing. It will also help you with things like sleight of hand and picking pockets.</p><p><strong>Intelligence (Int)</strong>: Your powers of thought, analysis, and understanding. Useful for healing, evaluating, and general knowledge, and vital for the understanding and casting of magical spells.</p><p><strong>Willpower (WP)</strong>: General strength of mind, and your ability to shrug off difficulty and plough on with the job in hand. It helps with resisting all sorts of influence and coercion, and guards against fear and terror.</p><p><strong>Fellowship (Fel)</strong>: Your ability to get on with people and come across as generally pleasant and acceptable. It will help you when chatting to locals or commanding people in battle, charming the guards or attempting to bribe them, and, for pious characters, communicating with your deity.</p><h4>Characteristic Bonuses</h4><p>The first or ‘tens’ digit of each Characteristic is its bonus value. So Strength 35 has a Strength Bonus of 3, and a Toughness of 47 has a Toughness Bonus of 4. Characteristic Bonuses are used in a variety of different ways throughout the rules, especially in combat.</p><h3>Movement and Wounds</h3><p><strong>Movement (M)</strong>: Your Movement describes how quickly you can move.</p><p><strong>Wounds (W)</strong>: Your Wounds show how much Damage you can endure based on your physical power and your force of will to shrug off injury. See the Injury Reference Sheet for more on Wounds.</p><h3>Character Skills</h3><p>Characters who are trained or practiced will have Skills to show this. Skills are used in the place of Characteristics for Test.</p><p><strong>Athletics</strong>: Run, jump, and heft.</p><p><strong>Bribery</strong>: Bribe someone.</p><p><strong>Channelling</strong>: Manipulate Magic.</p><p><strong>Charm</strong>: Charm others.</p><p><strong>Charm Animal</strong>: Charm animals.</p><p><strong>Climb</strong>: Scale surfaces.</p><p><strong>Consume Alcohol</strong>: Tolerate alcohol.</p><p><strong>Cool</strong>: Keep in control.</p><p><strong>Dodge</strong>: Avoid things.</p><p><strong>Endurance</strong>: Ignore hardships.</p><p><strong>Haggle</strong>: Make a bargain.</p><p><strong>Heal</strong>: Heal Wounds.</p><p><strong>Intimidate</strong>: Coerce others.</p><p><strong>Intuition</strong>: Read others.</p><p><strong>Language (Magick)</strong>: Cast spells.</p><p><strong>Leadership</strong>: Command others.</p><p><strong>Lore (Various)</strong>: Know something.</p><p><strong>Navigation</strong>: Find your way.</p><p><strong>Outdoor Survival</strong>: Subsist out-of-doors.</p><p><strong>Perception</strong>: Spot details.</p><p><strong>Pick Lock</strong>: Bypass locks.</p><p><strong>Ride</strong>: Ride a horse.</p><p><strong>Stealth</strong>: Creep around.</p><p><strong>Track</strong>: Follow a trail.</p><p><strong>Trade (Various)</strong>: Craft something.</p>",

      "Content": "<h3>Simple Tests</h3>\n<p>Most Tests are Simple Tests. These tell you if you succeed or fail. Roll 1d100, and if the result is less than or equal to your Skill or Characteristic, you succeed! Otherwise, you fail. Failing can mean things simply take longer, not that the attempt is completely fruitless, as the GM decides.</p>\n<p>Example: Salundra is searching the market for a new leather jacket. The GM calls for a Simple Perception Test. So, Salundra’s Player rolls 1d100 and scores 43. Salundra’s Perception Skill is 32. Because 43 is higher than 32, Salundra fails in her attempt, and the GM decides it takes quite some time to find the jacket in the crowded market, and asks what the other Players are doing as Salundra searches. If Salundra’s Player had rolled 32 or less, the Perception attempt would have succeeded, and the GM would explain that Salundra spots a clothes stall almost immediately!</p>\n<h3>Difficulty</h3>\n<p>Some Tests are more difficult than others — climbing a sheer wall is much harder than climbing a tree. To simulate this, the GM can assign a Difficulty to any Test. This will either add a positive bonus or a negative penalty, making the Test easier or harder to pass.</p>\n<p>The following Difficulty levels may be applied as the GM feels is appropriate: Very Easy (+60), Easy (+40), Average (+20), Challenging (+0), Difficult (−10), Hard (−20), or Very Hard (−30). The modifier is applied directly to the tested Skill, either lowering or raising the target number of the Test. If a Test has no marked modifier, it is assumed to be Challenging (+0).</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Molli decides to chat to the passing Ubersreikers to ask where the nearest bun shop is. The GM calls for an Average (+20) Gossip Test. Molli’s Gossip Skill is 50, but that is increased by +20 to 70 because of the Average Difficulty. Molrella’s player rolls 59. Normally, a roll over her Skill of 50 would be a fail, but because of the Difficulty bonus, the Test is a success, and Molli is pointed in the direction of the nearest food stall. Molli would only fail that Test if she rolled over her modified Skill of 70.</em></p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 class=\"no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>Outcomes Table</em></h3>\n<table style=\"width:97.8632%\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:15.5308%\"><em><strong>SL</strong></em></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:19.7002%\"><em><strong>Result</strong></em></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:64.5536%\"><em><strong>Have You Succeeded?</strong></em></td>\n<th style=\"width:0.218826%\"> </th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:15.5308%\"><em>+6 or more</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:19.7002%\"><em>Astounding Success</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:64.5536%\"><em>Yes, perfectly!

Like Simple Tests, roll 1d100 to determine if a Test is a success or a failure. Then subtract the ‘tens’ number of the 1d100 roll from the ‘tens’ number of the Skill or Characteristic being Tested. The result is your Success Level (SL). A positive SL occurs when you succeed at a Test — the higher the number, the better a Test succeeds. A negative SL occurs when you fail — the lower the number, the worse it has failed. Use the Outcomes Table below to understand what each SL means for your Tests.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Example</strong></em><strong>: </strong>Gunnar has grown bored of the market and decides to push through the crowds to reach the entertainers he can hear playing music in the distance. Gunnar decides to gruffly push his way through, so the GM asks for an Average (+20) Dramatic Intimidate Test. Gunnar’s Player rolls 26 against his Intimidate of 63 (43 for his Skill, plus 20 for the Difficulty). The tens number of his Intimidate of 63 is 6, and the tens number of his roll of 26 is 2. So, Gunnar scores +4 SL (6 – 2 = 4). According to the Outcomes Table, that’s an Impressive Success! Clearly, no one wants to interfere with the Dwarf Slayer, and the crowds part as soon as they see Gunnar’s distinctive orange hair.</p>\n<h3 class=\"no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center\"><em>OPPOSED TESTS</em></h3>\n<p><em>Two Characters can directly compare Tests to see who performs better. Doing this requires an Opposed Test. An Opposed Test compares the results of a Dramatic Test from each Character. The Character with the higher SL</em></p>\n<p><em>on the Outcomes Table is declared the Winner, and the difference between the individual SLs is used as the final SL for the Opposed Test. On a draw, the Characters should reroll their Tests to secure a Winner.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Example</strong></em>: Amris decides he wants to buy a new hat. The GM calls for an Opposed Haggle Test against the vendor. Amris’s Player rolls 51 against his Haggle Skill of 48, a fail with −1 SL. The vendor rolls 69 against his Haggle Skill of 40, also failing with −2 SL. As Amris has the higher SL (−1 SL, whilst a fail, is still higher than −2 SL), he is the Winner with a final SL of +1 (the difference between the rolled SLs). It was a clumsy exchange, and neither spoke well, but Amris performed marginally better to win the Opposed Test, letting him buy the hat for the Haggle Price.</p>\n<p><em>Opposed Tests often compare different Skills.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Example</strong></em>: An angry wizard-hating burgher confronts Ferdinand. Ferdinand’s Player asks if he can use the Charm Skill to calm the irate woman. The GM calls for an Opposed Charm/Cool Test. Ferdinand rolls 12 against his Charm Skill of 23 for a success with +1 SL. The GM rolls 34 against the burgher’s Cool Skill of 35 for a success with +0 SL. So, even though the burgher rolled a success, Ferdinand rolled a better success. Therefore, Ferdinand is the Winner with +1 SL. The GM states this enough to calm the burgher down, but not for long…</p>\n</blockquote>",
