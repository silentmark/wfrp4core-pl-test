      "Content": "<p>Part 2 opens with the Characters imprisoned beneath the @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.ZIp8EucvZLoWbxV9]{Watch Barracks} in the @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.iuChMNeuKpG8Hy91]{Precinct} district of Ubersreik. They’ve spent a crowded night with the other brawlers, all of whom are awaiting their arraignment. All weapons were confiscated with the assurance they will be returned if sentencing goes well. </p>\n<p>White-faced mime artists surround the party gesticulating energetically but refuse to talk. These brilliantly garbed clowns have argued for hours about the merits of various face paints; there’s a delightful Halfling girl with a long, hand-made beard named Gerlindelallen: ‘<em>Call me Geri. Naw, I am not a Dwarf, look at the size of me hands! Far too small!</em>’ and an old ‘mutant’ named Henroth. But not really. </p>\n<p>Henroth is a carnival player dressed as a ‘mutant’ for a play. He is covered in shimmering-gold metallic paint, now flaking and leaving little trails of glitter behind him. His right arm is enclosed within a huge bedraggled ‘tentacle’ made of felt and leather. He offers kind Characters a pull from a flask of brandy he keeps hidden in his ‘special mutant’ arm. ‘<em>Superstitious sods don’t even want to touch it</em>.’ Everyone is covered in dried pie and flaking mud. The stench makes everyone hungry and a little nauseous at the same time.</p>\n<p>For hours, various cell mates are taken away in ones and twos. Rumour has it the legal apparatus of Ubersreik is rapidly throwing fines at everyone who participated in the brawl before letting them go. No one knows who started the brawl. The carnival folk claim it certainly wasn’t them, ‘<em>Bad for business, innit!’</em> . Some blame Jungfreud supporters. Others blame the Altdorfers. The watchmen certainly aren’t talking — most of them sport bruises and resentful glares. Characters that make a Simple Gossip or Perception Test note the Watch members are all from Altdorf, though they wear gold and blue Ubersreik’s livery and deep frowns.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image\"><img class=\"fit\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/jail.webp\" /></div>\n<h3><strong>Off To Court</strong></h3>\n<p>In the late morning, the Characters hear a Watchman calling their names. As they exit the cell, they are clad in manacles and find a sizable escort of soldiers awaiting them outside the barracks. If @UUID[Actor.Z5D8INeGdPo4esse]{Salundra} is present, she is afforded far more courtesy than the rest of the Characters and is not shackled. If @UUID[Actor.qbWReZE7UL1p6JXG]{Gunnar} is present, all of the soldiers take a firm grip on their weapons as he passes and watch him closely. </p>\n<p>If @UUID[Actor.VdDotfA5zyWYdtwc]{Ferdinand} is with the group and used any magic during the brawl, he is gagged to stop him casting spells, and a Warrior Priest of Sigmar stands with the soldiers. When the wizard exits the barracks, the priest walks forward to stare him in the eye and growls: ‘<em>If you so much as twitch wrong, I’ll cave your skull in</em>!’</p>\n<p>Low-lying fog drifts over the streets and slightly muffles sound as the party is marched through the @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.iuChMNeuKpG8Hy91]{Precinct} and over @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.yY5DUbAdKg2MhDva]{Ubersreik Bridge}. As they approach the @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.U4xIUC3CfKZAgVSR]{Marktplatz}, they can hear the murmurs of a crowd in the distance. Their escort steers them towards a daunting stone building on the east side of the market: Ubersreik’s @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.XwIhOxNlvrgkuqme]{Town Hall}. </p>\n<p>A jeering crowd awaits them, only parting reluctantly as soldiers force them back to create a corridor. The crowd is yelling all sorts of encouragement and accusations: ‘<em>Those are the ones that killed my cow!</em>’; ‘<em>Jungfreud scum</em>!’; ‘<em>Give ’em what for</em>!’; ‘<em>Murderers</em>!’; ‘<em>Serves you right, Altdorfers are here to help us!</em>’; ‘<em>Best of luck</em>!’; ‘<em>Go home</em>!’; ‘<em>3 to 1 says the bloody noble gets off wiv murder!</em>’; ‘<em>He turned me into a snake!</em>’</p>\n<p>The Characters are led into the once pristine Nobles’ Court from which House Jungfreuds’ representatives used to make their rulings. The court’s stone walls are scarred with the marks of recent conflict. Bloodstains still show in several places where Jungfreud supporters were killed. Altdorf-liveried soldiers line the walls and makeshift benches are installed on an upper balcony for spectators. An elaborately robed judge draped in black and red, wearing a long, white wig sits upon a high dais peering down. A small pair of spectacles sits upon a long beak-like nose. He leans forward to study the party with evident interest. This is the right honourable Judge Melierte, a hard man, but generally considered fair. For an Empire judge that is...</p>\n<p>Judge Melierte looks at his clerks. ‘<em>Are these the accused</em>?’ A clerk reads the Characters’ names one by one, pausing to look up each time awaiting a nod or similar signal from the name he called. Satisfied, the clerk nods to the judge. <em>‘Very well, read the charges.’ </em>The clerk clears his throat and then intones:<em> ‘<strong>You stand accused of destruction of private property, disruption of commerce, inciting a riot, contributing to general lawlessness, and murder.’ </strong></em></p>\n<p>The Judge looks down at the party and asks, ‘<em>How do you plead</em>?’ Before the (presumably stunned) Characters can say anything, a voice rings out in the courtroom: ‘<em>Don’t say a word!</em>’ A black-robed woman in a wig storms into the courtroom. She flashes a smile at the Characters then, slightly breathless, turns to address the judge. ‘<em>Your pardon, your Honour, but I need a brief recess to consult with my clients before they say anything they’ll regret</em>.’ Judge Melierte looks from the woman to the Characters and asks, ‘<em>These, Osanna? Really?</em>’ He snorts and shakes his head before pounding his gavel once. ‘<em>We shall have a short recess. Hensil, fetch me a pie, preferably one that wasn’t involved in the market brawl.</em>’</p>\n<h3><strong>Lawyering Up</strong></h3>\n<p>The Characters are swiftly escorted into a nearby antechamber. One or two lingering guards are all but shoved out by the woman who firmly closes the door behind them, before turning to the party with a winning smile. ‘<em>Well, it seems we’re in a spot of trouble, eh?</em>’ Obviously, this is a massive understatement. The woman introduces herself as @UUID[Actor.aUTBY5s6vCJhZsZp]{Barrister Osanna Winandus}, ‘<em>but, just call me Osanna, eh?</em>’ </p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/osanna-winandus.webp\" width=\"195\" height=\"248\" /></div>\n<p>Characters can make an <strong>Average (+20) Simple Lore (Empire)</strong> or <strong>Easy (+40) Simple Lore (Law) </strong>Test to see if they remember hearing of a Osanna. Success indicates they know she is a prominent barrister of the Reikland who typically handles the cases of the wealthiest merchants. She was partially trained by the Cult of Verena (which she shows by having owls stitched into her robes — a favoured symbol of @UUID[JournalEntry.NcH9OhleJFfaUdon.JournalEntryPage.9bWE0Ayt5XGQf50r]{Verena, Goddess of Justice, Law, and Knowledge}). </p>\n<p>Typically, barristers only represent very wealthy clients, as they are the only lawyers allowed to address the higher appellate courts of the Empire. Use @UUID[Actor.aUTBY5s6vCJhZsZp]{Osanna} to get the Players roleplaying as their Characters. Have her ask and answer questions, and directly address any Players who are being quiet to bring them into the game.</p>\n<p>She pauses to read over a scroll she claimed from one of the law clerks. She shakes her head as she reads it. ‘<em>Art critics are we? They’re trying to lay the whole of the riot at your feet. Says here you started the brawl, attacked soldiers, near ransacked the town and… oh, dear, killed Fosten the Fiery. The children will never forgive you that one.</em>’ She pats the hand of any Character that exclaims they didn’t kill the fire breather. ‘<em>Of course you didn’t, darling.</em>’ The Characters doubtless have some questions for the barrister. If the Characters ask about the Judge’s comment, she laughs and says, ‘<em>I have somewhat of a reputation for taking on lost causes</em>’. The following are the mostly likely questions they may ask and how she may respond: </p>\n<p><strong>We didn’t hire you (and we can’t afford you). Who did?</strong></p>\n<p>Osanna’s answer to this question depends on the Characters’ previous actions. </p>\n<p>If they saved the elderly woman and the young girl from the knife-wielding ruffians, Osanna says, ‘<em>The Karstadts care very much about their family and they remember their friends. Young Jocelin’s mother thanks you with all her heart… and my humble services</em>.’ See @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.hKYVOZhK3VE53P87]{Karstadt Estate} for more on the Karstadt Family family. </p>\n<p>If the Characters didn’t involve themselves in the girl’s plight (or were unaware of it) Osanna says: ‘<em>These are difficult times for Ubersreik, and justice is all too often denied in such times. I am occasionally called upon to make certain that the scales are balanced. Your benefactors prefer to remain anonymous, but if I can get you out of this mess, donations to the Cult of Verena would not go amiss</em>.’</p>\n<p><strong>Who has accused us? </strong></p>\n<p>‘<em>Everyone. And that is very suspicious in and of itself. In point of fact, I happen to know that one of the witnesses listed here is blind. You’ve been set up to take a fall, so we have to be very careful how we proceed. You have enemies, or maybe friends, in very high places.</em>’</p>\n<p><strong>Who set us up for a fall?</strong></p>\n<p><em>‘I haven’t the faintest</em>.’ Although Osanna isn’t strictly lying here, she isn’t really telling the truth, either. The Characters are potentially very dangerous and very useful to the right people. Several powerful groups know not all is well in the shadows of Ubersreik, and already manoeuvres to manipulate and use the Characters have begun. In particular, one individual was alerted to the Characters by an agent in the market, @UUID[Actor.TZ4421xw2VOuXX1z]{Heske Glazer}. </p>\n<p>It’s your call to decide who this mysterious manipulator is. Refer to the @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG]{A Guide to Ubersreik} for ideas, but obvious choices include: @UUID[JournalEntry.70sJnVPsNmeNnqdC.JournalEntryPage.i5oKhDottkJmwCzj]{Duke Brynich Aschaffenberg}, @UUID[Actor.Je9bENZeEyEaQR9p]{Hellin Karstadt-Stampf}, @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.U5fSG8wDw2ZCLIWG]{Lady Kisaya von Bruner}, Lady @UUID[Actor.hcAF95tFaOdoZoeF]{Lady Emmanuelle Nacht} or @UUID[Actor.gfSfXHgfqW5QiUxu]{General von Daberninck}, anyone on the Ubersreik @UUID[JournalEntry.0c4m9HIzORIyYLkp.JournalEntryPage.FZ6VFcaXq1EzHmXF#town-council]{Town Council}, or even Andreas von Bruner. </p>\n<p>Whomever it is, @UUID[Actor.aUTBY5s6vCJhZsZp]{Osanna} likely knows where the money paying for her services is sourced, though she will not volunteer this information.</p>\n<p><strong>What is your counsel?</strong></p>\n<p>‘<em>You have little hope of being found innocent if you plead not guilty, as you were involved in the riot. Rather, we will make a “no contest” plea, admitting neither guilt, nor claiming total innocence, though we will hotly deny killing Fosten.’ </em>Osanna grins at this.<em> ‘Generally heavy fees and hard labour in the Grey Mountains would be the minimum sentence with such a plea, but I have some sway with the court, and I know they have been requested to support the Watch in these trying times, as it is severely depleted…’ </em></p>\n<p>If the Characters express astonishment at this notion — such as asking why the Watch would accept them if they were ‘criminals’, Osanna laughs heartily. ‘<em>Have you met our current Watch? It’s mostly comprised of the very worst soldiers from the Altdorf State Army, aided by idiots and fools. You’ll fit right in, given your martial leanings, and should be able to quickly make your mark. Besides, it would help smooth matters in town if we had some more folk on the Watch who cared about Ubersreik and the people here.’</em></p>\n<p>If any Characters with the Lore (Law) Skill pass a <strong>Simple Lore (Law)</strong> Test, they will know that something is very odd here. Most Empire courts would reject such a ‘no contest’ plea out of hand. A passed <strong>Average (+20) Simple Intuition</strong> Tests indicate the barrister seems to be honest (well, as honest as any lawyer can ever be). </p>\n<p>@UUID[Actor.aUTBY5s6vCJhZsZp]{Osanna} states that the Characters certainly don’t have to follow her counsel, and can ‘<em>take their chances with the mercy of the court’ if they wish. She then notes:</em> <em>‘If you are held responsible for the death of Fosten the Fiery, you will be executed. If you somehow manage to talk your way out of that — not that the court will even bother to listen or give you a chance to explain yourselves — but are still found guilty of the other charges, at the very least, you’ll see several years of hard labour at Ubersreik’s penal quarry in the foothills of the Grey Mountains. It’s not a nice place. Prisoners there are frequently killed by raiding greenskins before their sentences are finished.’</em></p>\n<p>If the Characters accept @UUID[Actor.aUTBY5s6vCJhZsZp]{Osanna’s} expert advice, she tells them to let her do the talking unless the judge asks them a direct question. </p>\n<p>If @UUID[Actor.Z5D8INeGdPo4esse]{Salundra} is present, @UUID[Actor.aUTBY5s6vCJhZsZp]{Osanna} tells her that, as a noble, she is allowed to address the court if she wishes, but that normal provisions for the nobility are in somewhat of a legal grey area as the town has no formal ruler. Osanna will strongly recommend Salundra request clemency, and offer her services as a trained soldier of the Empire. Indeed, if Salundra were to offer her service to the Watch, it would almost certainly avoid a steeper sentence, and would help the case.</p>\n<p>The Characters may well suspect that they’re being set up, and @UUID[Actor.aUTBY5s6vCJhZsZp]{Osanna} will merely nod, because they almost certainly are. Someone clearly has a vested interest in seeing the party join the Watch. If it seems likely the Characters will attempt something foolish in an attempt to avoid this fate, Osanna will remark that violence is particularly unwise as the they are outnumbered, shackled, and without weapons.</p>\n<p>Once all the Characters’ questions are answered and the party is ready to face its judgement, @UUID[Actor.aUTBY5s6vCJhZsZp]{Osanna} leaves the antechamber briefly to tell the court that the Characters are prepared to proceed. She then leads the party back into the waiting courtroom. </p>\n<p>If the party accepts @UUID[Actor.aUTBY5s6vCJhZsZp]{Barrister Winandus’} advice and lets her talk in their stead, Osanna declares to the judge that the party is not directly contesting the charges, but notes the Characters certainly didn’t start the fight. She then claims the party only acted in self-defence, and unquestionably did not kill Fosten the Fiery. To reinforce this, she notes that none of the party owns a crossbow, the weapon by which the fire breather was killed (obviously, if one of the Characters does own a crossbow, she does not bring this up!). </p>\n<p>If @UUID[Actor.Z5D8INeGdPo4esse]{Salundra} intends to speak, the barrister then gestures her forwards with a nod and a smile. The noble soldier can then make an <strong>Average (+20) Simple Charm</strong> Test to present herself well.</p>\n<p>Success means that Judge Melierte is impressed, which could certainly help @UUID[Actor.Z5D8INeGdPo4esse]{Salundra} in the future should she fall into trouble again. Failure means he writes her off as a someone of little interest, and ignores her appeals.</p>\n<p>After @UUID[Actor.Z5D8INeGdPo4esse]{Salundra} has spoken (if she chooses to) the Judge asks each Character a question, and expects to be answered, providing another opportunity for the Players to each roleplay their Characters.</p>\n<p><strong>Salundra</strong>:<em> ‘So, Lady von Drakenburg, whatever will your lord-father say when he finds out what his daughter considers good use of her time?’</em></p>\n<p><strong>Gunnar</strong>: <em>‘How exactly is the Slayer’s Oath served by destroying our Marktplatz?’</em></p>\n<p><strong>Molrella</strong>: ‘<em>However did someone as innocuous as you get involved in this awful situation, my dear? It seems hardy likely you are involved by your own desire!’</em></p>\n<p><strong>Ferdinand</strong>: <em>‘Are you aware of the penalties for misuse of magic, wizard? It’s difficult to cast spells without a tongue, I’m told. What will you tell your master of these events?’</em></p>\n<p><strong>Amris</strong>:<em> ‘I’m not very familiar with Elves, Master Emberfell. Do your kind always riot when a play goes awry?’</em></p>\n<p><strong>Else</strong>: <em>‘You keep strange company, Fraulein Sigloben. I know somewhat of your family. What <strong>would</strong> your Mother think?’</em></p>\n<div class=\"journal-image\"><img class=\"fit\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/court.webp\" /></div>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>Grimnir's Chosen</em></h3>\n<p><em>Slayers are sworn to seek a death in battle against worthy foes of their folk, but the purpose of their oath is to reclaim their honour. One’s honour cannot be reclaimed while breaking other oaths in the process. The famed Slayer Kings of Karak Kadrin have each held the terrible burden of the conflicting oaths of a King and a Slayer for five generations. Judge Melierte will demand an oath from any Slayer vowing not to allow the Slayer Oath to conflict with any duties as a member of the Watch.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If any of the Characters did something especially noteworthy during the brawl, the judge may refer to it in passing. If they fought the ruffians, he also says the following:</p>\n<p><em>‘You claim not to have killed Fosten, but I’ve seen a report that says you did kill others. What happened?’</em></p>\n<p>After Judge Melierte has finished with the questions and answers, he waves the barrister forward and briefly confers with her quietly. Finally, he addresses the whole court:</p>\n<p><em>‘It seems fairly unlikely that these gathered here managed to assault the entire Marktplatz on their own. However, we also commend them on not bothering to waste the Court’s time on frivolous protestations of innocence. Thus we are inclined to be merciful.’ </em></p>\n<p>If @UUID[Actor.Z5D8INeGdPo4esse]{Salundra} volunteered their services, he rolls her offer into the following. ‘<em>After careful review of the evidence and circumstances surrounding this case, it is my view that those who had a hand in disrupting the peace of our fair town should also have a hand in restoring it. I sentence you all to supervised duty on the Watch in order that you may work off your debt to Ubersreik. This duty will commence tomorrow for a period not to exceed three years. Failure to carry out your new duties shall be looked at as treason to the Empire and is <strong>punishable by death</strong>. In Verena’s name, I so rule. Your case is concluded. Hensil, bring me a glass of Bordeleaux'</em></p>\n<p>@UUID[Actor.aUTBY5s6vCJhZsZp]{Osanna} grins at the Characters and makes a slight bow. If any are shocked by the sentence, she quietly notes that, ‘<em>Three years of supervised duty is immensely preferable to an immediate noose. Besides, give me time, I may be able to work an alternative to this at a later date. Personally, I’m delighted with this outcome.’</em> After all, this is exactly the outcome Osanna’s secret employer requested.</p>\n<p>And with that, Part 2 is concluded.</p>",

By that point, Sergeant @UUID[Actor.xiyFua5KmhBnskjG]{Klumpenklug} is unlikely to be the party’s favourite person. One day, just after the Characters break up a brawl, a heavy-set woman in her late 40s approaches. She looks at the party’s work and nods in appreciation. ‘<em>Thank the gods! Found you. Name’s Ilse Fassenwütend. Road Sergeant. Have a job for you. It’ll clear you from Klumpenklug. And the whole Watch! If you’re interested, meet me tonight at the Exploding Pig. I’ll explain everything there.</em>’ She saunters off with a wave, ignoring further questions.</p><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/ilse-fassenwutend.webp\" width=\"256\" height=\"256\" /></div><p>@UUID[Actor.5nUNhvoRVnaBE4hw]{Fassenwütend} has lived a hard life. Her once bronze hair is streaked white, and a curving scar runs from her right eye to her jawline. She habitually sips from an old flask. Everything about her is worn or dishevelled, except her immaculate pistols. Their wooden stocks polished, their steel meticulously oiled, ready to fire at any time.</p><p>Characters asking about her can make a <strong>Dramatic Gossip</strong> Test. Failure means they hear nothing. Success brings word she is dedicated to her job, and has a reputation for finishing what she starts. With 2 or more Success Levels, they learn she was once considered the best road warden captain in the duchy, but was demoted after the total loss of her outfit five years ago. None know the circumstances surrounding this.</p><h4><strong>To the Pig!</strong></h4><p>@UUID[Actor.5nUNhvoRVnaBE4hw]{Fassenwütend} shows up in @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.heftQyOHEycBpbGT]{The Exploding Pig} in the early evening. She’s cranky because she’s, ‘painfully sober’. She thanks the Characters for coming and shares the following story:</p><blockquote><p>‘There’s a prisoner. Stone mason. Name of Maurer. Cold bastard. Murdered many. Knocked a head clean off. Was tried. Found guilty. Awaits execution. All’s well, eh? Well, no. For good or ill, Reikland watches for signs. Holy signs. If a prisoner is scheduled for execution and something goes really wrong, the execution is stayed. Executioner’s axe breaks, or lightning strikes the headman’s block, it’s time to reschedule. Most times, second execution gets the job done. But not always. Sometimes things go wrong twice. Then a third date is set. A final date. You see, if the third execution goes wrong, it’s deemed to be the ‘Will of the Gods’ intervening for an innocent and the prisoner is set free. Fully pardoned. Twice Maurer has gone to the block. Twice he’s come back. The man is evil. Know it. Think the Dark Gods are watching him. His final execution date is approaching, yet the poor excuses for Watchmen here want no part of it. Sodden cowards…</p><p>So, that’s where you come in. Know Klumpenklug from way back. Total scum. Asked around about you. Reckoned you might want to be free of him. And the Watch. So, here’s the deal: you escort Maurer to the block with me, four days hence, and I will get your sentences commuted for service above and beyond. No more death sentence. No more Sergeant Crap-sack Klumpenklug. Free and clear. What do you say?’</p></blockquote><p>If you’ve managed to make @UUID[Actor.xiyFua5KmhBnskjG]{Klumpenklug} really horrible, the Characters may immediately accept! It’s also possible they will want to think about it. @UUID[Actor.5nUNhvoRVnaBE4hw]{Fassenwütend} accepts this, but states she needs an answer within two days, otherwise she’ll have to recruit elsewhere. If the Characters agree on the spot, she tells them she’ll meet them the day before the execution to go over the route. Condemned prisoners are typically executed at the @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.lrn5xDmRdlFmeUP0]{Thulmannplatz} in Ubersreik. But @UUID[Actor.eKsyvPwY0dDMpO27]{Maurer} will be escorted to the edge of Morr’s Field outside the town to be beheaded with the rising sun.</p><p>The two most likely questions the party will raise are: 1) Why does Fassenwütend need their help? 2) Why won’t the Watch help? On the first, she mutters, ‘<em>Hmm. Expect trouble. The man is evil</em>.’ On the latter, ‘<em>Cowardice and superstition. Former Watch Sergeant, Sen-something-or-another, she wanted no part of it. Convinced others. But she was a Jungfreud loyalist. So, now she’s gone. The new Altdorf crew can’t be arsed.’</em></p><p>If any Character asks her about the loss of her men five years ago, Fassenwütend  regards them for a long moment before shaking her head ‘<em>Was a band of Beastmen. Cunning scum. Took to preying merchant routes. Struck in darkness. Slew whole caravans. Faded away. Months passed. Finally figured out where they were. Arranged an ambush… Hrmm. Had hidden Mutants in my outfit. They warned the Beastmen and turned the ambush on us. I got out. No one else did.</em>’</p><h3><strong>Street Research</strong></h3><p>The Characters may wish to investigate before committing to help @UUID[Actor.5nUNhvoRVnaBE4hw]{Fassenwütend}. The following details what they may learn.</p><h4><strong>Legal Status</strong></h4><p>A character with Lore (Law) automatically knows @UUID[Actor.5nUNhvoRVnaBE4hw]{Fassenwütend} speaks the truth concerning stays of execution. A party without the Skill could call on @UUID[Actor.aUTBY5s6vCJhZsZp]{Barrister Winandus}. Osanna is delighted to see the Characters. She offers them law consultancy for just a single shilling having grown fond of the party. She is unfamiliar with Maurer’s case, but has heard of Fassenwütend. ‘<em>Hard as iron, I hear</em>.’  Osanna also confirms the road warden has enough pull to arrange for a commuted sentence, but adds: ‘<em>Surely not for mere escort duty. She expects violence. The Court would never hear her petition otherwise</em>.’ Osanna’s parting advice: ‘<em>Get it in writing. And signed</em>.’</p><h4><strong>Word from the Watch</strong></h4><p>It isn’t hard to discover why the Watch want nothing to do with the @UUID[Actor.eKsyvPwY0dDMpO27]{Maurer} case: they believe it’s cursed. All the watchmen assigned to escort Maurer to his first two execution dates have vanished. Some were Jungfreud loyalists, others suffered strange accidents — several were found to have drowned far from the river, or just disappeared (perhaps into the @UUID[Actor.22a2dbRVvo7bFk8u]{Teufel Terror’s} stomach?). All the new watchmen heard was that they should say ‘no’ to anything involving Maurer and that was that.</p><p>@UUID[Actor.eKsyvPwY0dDMpO27]{Maurer’s} case is from before @UUID[Actor.L0oHLYZcGQHDWKMo]{Captain Pfeffer’s} time, but she keeps tidy records. Maurer was accused, tried, and convicted of multiple counts of murder, including the killing of two watchmen, three river wardens, and two road wardens. Fassenwütend was likely referring to former Watch Sergeant Lenora Sendener, who left the Watch not long after Maurer’s second attempted execution, before the Jungfreud purges. Her whereabouts are unknown. Characters wishing to find this out without alerting the Captain or letting @UUID[Actor.xiyFua5KmhBnskjG]{Sergeant Klumpenklug} know what they are doing, will either need a really good story, or will need to break into the Captain’s office to check her files. Pfeffer’s door is secure, requiring a <strong>Difficult (-10) Dramatic Pick Lock</strong> Test to open. Failure means they can’t get in; an Impressive Failure means the Captain catches them and then they’ll really have some explaining to do. Any level of success opens the door.</p><p>If @UUID[Actor.xiyFua5KmhBnskjG]{Klumpenklug} hears anything about their interest, he turns pale, and states, ‘<em>You want no part of that. Maurer is cursed</em>’, and then directly orders the Characters to not get involved. If the Characters ask the @UUID[Actor.L0oHLYZcGQHDWKMo]{Captain} about @UUID[Actor.eKsyvPwY0dDMpO27]{Maurer’s} case directly, she’ll look troubled and state that she was told soldiers from Altdorf, not her Watch, are supposed to escort the mason to his execution. This is highly irregular. Characters will have to make an <strong>Opposed Charm/Cool</strong> Test with the Captain to convince her to allow them to escort Maurer, or to override Klumpenklug.</p><h4><strong>Word About Town</strong></h4><p>An <strong>Average (+20) Simple Gossip</strong> Test will yield results about @UUID[Actor.eKsyvPwY0dDMpO27]{Maurer}. Many results. But with little consensus. Some swear he is innocent. Others claim he is a Daemon in Human form. All agree he was a gifted stone mason who could cut even the most difficult of stone with precision. Characters scoring a success will be told that they should talk to his fiancée, Kristyn Gebauer, and are directed to where she regularly sells goods in the @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.U4xIUC3CfKZAgVSR]{Marktplatz}.</p><p>Gebauer proves to be a kind young woman who sells various tools for a merchant. She states with absolute conviction that her fiancé is not guilty. ‘<em>He did kill those men, but it was in self-defence. They told him terrible things, said he was one of them, though he knew them not. When he refused them, they tried to take him by force</em>.’ She doesn’t know what the ‘terrible things’ were as Maurer wouldn’t tell her. Nor does she know why the men wanted @UUID[Actor.eKsyvPwY0dDMpO27]{Maurer.} ‘<em>Holger is a good man. I’ve been praying to Verena that someone helps him before it is too late</em>.’ A successful <strong>Simple Intuition</strong> Test indicates she is telling the truth.</p><p>Characters that go looking for Lenora Sendener will have a more difficult task as she doesn’t want to be found. It requires success on a <strong>Hard (−20) Simple Gossip</strong> Test to score the information to find the former Watch Sergeant. The Difficulty can be lowered by one step for each 5 shillings a Character spends in seeking her. Success means the Character discovers Sendener took up with the river wardens and seldom returns to Ubersreik, but that she is presently staying along the @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.BQA04SKWoMFPjb7T]{Docks} at @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.ddQoNatt6T4Fd2ZY]{The Red Moon Inn}.</p><p>Sendener is a brusque, wiry woman with silvery hair held fast in tight cords. She doesn’t seem at all surprised to meet the party. ‘<em>Some cases just don’t die. Holger Maurer… Do yourselves a favour: just walk away. Nothing good will come of this. You know the men that accused Maurer of his crimes are all dead save one</em>? <em>A butcher named Narbe Ditwin. Heard his shop burned down recently. Pity he didn’t suffer the same fate</em>.’ Characters that helped people during the fire in Part Three may have actually saved Ditwin from the fire — have fun reminding them of this. Sendener is willing to say little else, save this: ‘<em>There are things in this world… if you ever learn them, you’ll wish for ignorance. For my part, I think Maurer innocent, but it doesn’t matter. They want him.’</em> Characters that try to use the Intimidate Skill on Sendener, or if they claim they could arrest her, receive a hearty laugh. She displays a symbol of her captain rank in the riverwardens. ‘<em>His Imperial Majesty disagrees with you. Time for you lot to move on. Sigmar be with you</em>.’</p><h3><strong>A Grim Decision</strong></h3><p>The Characters have two days to decide whether or not they intend to help @UUID[Actor.5nUNhvoRVnaBE4hw]{Fassenwütend}. If they refuse, she snorts in derision, ‘<em>Another pack of cowards. Fine</em>.’ She hires mercenaries to assist her, as she believes whatever soldiers are assigned to the task will be inadequate. See <strong>We Want No Part of This</strong>. If the party agrees to assist, Fassenwütend immediately explains the route, indicating that they’ll be meeting her well over an hour before dawn at a quiet @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.GXNNqy1wiejyIKx9]{Watch Station} on the southside of the Teufel where they’ll collect the prisoner. They will then take @UUID[Actor.eKsyvPwY0dDMpO27]{Maurer} along the bank of @UUID[JournalEntry.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.CqIczLRZI265nrAR]{The Teufel}, exiting Ubersreik via the West River Gate to escort him a short way to @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.eoXBXibg4X0OnT7p]{Morr's Field} where the executioner’s block awaits him. The road warden readily agrees to put their agreement in writing, signed and sealed with wax, if the party asks.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>We Want No Part of This</em></h3><p><em>The Characters may well take all the warnings to heart and decide, for whatever reasons, that they don’t wish to get involved, leaving Maurer to his fate. If such is the case, foretellings cast by members of the @UUID[JournalEntry.d8nvgs2H5MmtKhdM.JournalEntryPage.L5gV9pgaWXB3floP#the-shifting-grasp]{Shifting Grasp} indicate that the party may become a liability to their plans. </em></p><p><em>The night before Maurer’s execution, perhaps while the Characters are staggering home from a tavern, Diebold Bedrohung and his fellow mutants attack them in the dark, yelling ‘</em>You’ll not have our brother!’ <em>They retreat only once they’ve crippled or killed two of the PCs or they’ve lost two mutants. If the Characters don’t seek out the road warden, they’ll hear the next day she was killed along the Docks beside the mercenaries she hired, and that @UUID[Actor.eKsyvPwY0dDMpO27]{Holger Maurer} has escaped, his whereabouts unknown.

The Chaos moon, Morrsleib, rises full and fat, far larger than normal. It shines overhead with a sickly green light that does little to illuminate the heavy mist, but lends it an eerie glow that makes shadows move in inexplicable ways. </p><p>If the characters are officially sanctioned to escort @UUID[Actor.eKsyvPwY0dDMpO27]{Maurer}, only @UUID[Actor.5nUNhvoRVnaBE4hw]{Fassenwütend} awaits them at the @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.GXNNqy1wiejyIKx9]{Watch Station}, with two soldiers hurriedly handing off their manacled prisoner before immediately returning into their station and audibly baring the doors. If not, a pair of soldiers in Altdorf livery, who look clearly afraid, wait with the road warden. They are visibly happy to see ‘reinforcements’ in the form of the party. In the pale light of Fassenwütend’s lantern, Holger Maurer slumps forwards.</p><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/holger-maurer.webp\" width=\"202\" height=\"209\" /></div><div class=\"journal-image centered\" style=\"text-align:center\"><p>@UUID[Actor.eKsyvPwY0dDMpO27]{Holger Maurer}</p></div><h4><strong>Cold Fish</strong></h4><p>@UUID[Actor.5nUNhvoRVnaBE4hw]{Fassenwütend} regards @UUID[Actor.eKsyvPwY0dDMpO27]{Maurer} with a hostile glare. ‘<em>No accidents this time. To Morr’s Portal with you</em>.’ The stone mason returns softly, ‘<em>That is for Sigmar to decide</em>.’  The road warden snorts and sets off at a brisk pace. Have the Characters make <strong>Easy (+40) Simple Perception</strong> Tests. If successful, they realise that despite the swift pace, their footsteps are making no sounds under the thick, green fog.</p><p>As the Characters reach the @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.BQA04SKWoMFPjb7T]{Docks} along the banks of @UUID[JournalEntry.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.CqIczLRZI265nrAR]{the Teufel}, the fog partially clears away, giving them a clear view of the river and the bridge. The ruddy flows of the Teufel have changed. It runs thick, more black sludge than water, viscous and soundless. Dead fish can somehow be seen swimming in its depths, their eye sockets filled in with blue and pink fire, their bones illuminated. Hanging from the bridge, the decaying corpses of loyalist Jungfreud supporters struggle against their nooses, clawing at their throats with bony hands, reaching rotting fingers out towards the party for succour. As the party passes the bridge, a pseudopod of black water rises from the river and almost casually snares a lone fisherman off a dock (or one of the guards escorting @UUID[Actor.eKsyvPwY0dDMpO27]{Maurer} if there are any) pulling them into the flow to be torn to pieces by skeletal fish. Time for <strong>Dramatic Cool</strong> Tests to resist the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.traits.pTorrE0l3VybAbtn]{Fear} Trait.</p><h4><strong>The Shifting Grasp Arrive</strong></h4><p>A sonorous voice echoes out of the fog, seemingly from every direction at once: ‘<em>You belong with us, Brother Holger.’</em> @UUID[Actor.5nUNhvoRVnaBE4hw]{Fassenwütend}, pale yet determined, yells, ‘<em>Come on!’</em> and runs, drawing a pistol with one hand as she steadies her lantern with the other. Have all the Characters make a <strong>Simple Perception</strong> Test, except those still grappling with Fear (they fail the test automatically). Those who fail are @Condition[Surprised] by the figures that lunge out of the fog. The followers of Tzeentch, the Chaos God of Change, have come to collect their ‘prize’. </p><p>The attackers are a band of mutants belonging to the chaos cult, @UUID[JournalEntry.d8nvgs2H5MmtKhdM.JournalEntryPage.L5gV9pgaWXB3floP#the-shifting-grasp]{The Shifting Grasp}. They have long sought to convince @UUID[Actor.eKsyvPwY0dDMpO27]{Maurer} to give his allegiance to their terrible master. The men Maurer killed were all @UUID[Actor.iIntWLH5K7u7nF8W]{Shifting Grasp cultists}, including the road warden’s friend (though she does not know this). @UUID[Actor.Q89Gj2QfksawqmnT]{Diebold Bedrohung}, one of the cults more competent agents, leads the mutants.</p><div style=\"display:flex;justify-content:space-evenly;flex-wrap:wrap\"><div style=\"display:flex;flex-direction:column;justify-content:space-evenly;align-items:center\"><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/diebold-bedrohung.webp\" width=\"226\" height=\"222\" /><p style=\"text-align:center\">@UUID[Actor.Q89Gj2QfksawqmnT]{Diebold Bedrohung}</p></div><div style=\"display:flex;flex-direction:column;justify-content:space-evenly;align-items:center\"><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/mutant-cultists.webp\" width=\"231\" height=\"225\" /><p style=\"text-align:center\">@UUID[Actor.iIntWLH5K7u7nF8W]{Shifting Grasp Mutants}</p></div></div><h4><strong>Diebold Bedrohung and the Mutant Cultist</strong></h4><p>@UUID[Actor.Q89Gj2QfksawqmnT]{Bedrohung} is bulky, with mottled skin that resembles the colour of tarnished bronze and eyes like a massive owl. When injured, he ‘bleeds’ molten brass. He attacks with a sharp sword, all the while continually asking Maurer why he is not joining his ‘brothers’ in slaying the Watch that means to kill him.</p><p>There are a number of @UUID[Actor.iIntWLH5K7u7nF8W]{Shifting Grasp Mutants} equal to the number of Characters+3. The Mutants are armed with sharpened gaff hooks. All are dressed in dark robes and have visible mutations. One has transparent skin, her muscles and bones clearly showing. Another has a greatly distended throat, resembling that of a toad. After the first time he is struck for damage, the toad-ish mutant spews a torrent of rotten fish, bones, and bile at his attacker. </p><p>The attacker must make a <strong>Simple Agility</strong> Test or immediately lose all Advantage and take 5 Wounds that ignore Armour. The other mutations are cosmetic only, and can be described as you prefer — maybe colourful feathers twisting to crying faces, horrendous boils containing glowing lights, or constantly flaking skin that turns to tears as it peels free.</p><p>Add an extra Mutant if the Characters rescued @UUID[Actor.ZvthiqduALEhSmwK]{Narbe Ditwin} in @UUID[.zm7OiFjYdcQ76OdN#fire!]{Fire!} From @UUID[.zm7OiFjYdcQ76OdN]{Part 3}. Narbe leaps from the fog, his torso is now exposed, displaying bright pink and turquoise scales! If he is at all thankful for the characters saving his life, it doesn’t show as he swings his gaff hook, grinning maniacally as Morrslieb’s green light reflects in his vacant eyes.</p><p>Due to the thick fog, all Ranged Attacks are <strong>Hard (−20).</strong> After the Round 1 of combat, @UUID[Actor.eKsyvPwY0dDMpO27]{Maurer} dives in to help the party, calling on Sigmar’s name, assaulting the Mutants with his manacled hands until he can scoop up a gaff hook and use it (counts as the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.traits.AtpAudHA4ybXVlWM]{Weapon +8} Trait in his hands). He will use his @UUID[Actor.eKsyvPwY0dDMpO27.Item.S0aOLmEZhjC1bh16]{Piercing Gaze} Trait before attacking, meaning he will spend 1 Round studying his opponent. @UUID[Actor.5nUNhvoRVnaBE4hw]{Fassenwütend} joins the fray immediately, firing her two pistols first before stabbing at anyone she can with her sword.</p><p>If more than half the party goes down, @UUID[Actor.eKsyvPwY0dDMpO27]{Maurer} is seized and a cloth is held over his face by a tentacle. He collapses, unconscious, and the mutants spirit him away, with the rest swiftly retreating. The Characters will have to chase after them or accept their failure. The @UUID[Actor.5nUNhvoRVnaBE4hw]{road warden} will not help them in such a case. Slaying @UUID[Actor.Q89Gj2QfksawqmnT]{Bedrohung} will cause the rest of the mutants to flee. He will not stop attacking, or imploring Maurer, until he is dead. Maurer spits on his corpse. If the Characters ask why he helped them, he shrugs with a wan smile, ‘<em>They were mutants</em>.’ With the retreat of the @UUID[JournalEntry.d8nvgs2H5MmtKhdM.JournalEntryPage.L5gV9pgaWXB3floP#the-shifting-grasp]{Shifting Grasp}, the light shifts as the sky lightens in the east and Morrslieb’s light fades.</p><div class=\"journal-image\"><img class=\"fit\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/cultist-ambush.webp\" /></div><h3><strong>Moment Of Truth</strong></h3><p>After thwarting the attack of @UUID[JournalEntry.d8nvgs2H5MmtKhdM.JournalEntryPage.L5gV9pgaWXB3floP#the-shifting-grasp]{The Shifting Grasp}, @UUID[Actor.5nUNhvoRVnaBE4hw]{Fassenwütend} and any surviving Characters pass through the River Gate unopposed, and make their way to the execution. The crumbling stone walls of @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.eoXBXibg4X0OnT7p]{Morr’s Field} rise to their northwest, dark and foreboding, even in the slowly rising light. Maurer collapses to his knees, clasps his hands together and whispers brokenly, ‘<em>Sigmar, aid your servant. I have done no wrong</em>.’</p><p>The road warden has Willpower 56 should a Character wish to persuade her to let @UUID[Actor.eKsyvPwY0dDMpO27]{Maurer} go. She only has 7 Wounds left if they wish to persuade her in a <em>different </em>fashion.</p><p>If the Characters do nothing, @UUID[Actor.5nUNhvoRVnaBE4hw]{Fassenwütend} guides @UUID[Actor.eKsyvPwY0dDMpO27]{Maurer} to the block where a hooded executioner awaits him on the edge of @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.eoXBXibg4X0OnT7p]{Morr's Field}. Maurer prays to Sigmar as he takes his place upon the block and lowers his head. Fassenwütend stands guard beside him. The executioner raises his axe high and says firmly, ‘<em>No. Not, Sigmar</em>’ then buries it in Fassenwütend’s skull. The executioner’s eyes flare a brilliant fiery pink through his hood and he roars with laughter as he, along with an amazed Maurer, melt into the ground, executioner’s block and all, the ground warping back into place as if they were never there. </p><p>All Characters witnessing this must make a <strong>Simple Cool</strong> Test or gain 1 Corruption Point. Hopefully, they got something from the @UUID[Actor.5nUNhvoRVnaBE4hw]{road warden} in writing.</p><p>If @UUID[Actor.eKsyvPwY0dDMpO27]{Maurer} is set free in whatever manner, he is stunned and tearfully grateful. ‘<em>I swear on my soul, I will not forget what you have done, not in all the days of my life. May Verena guide you and Sigmar watch over your steps.</em>’ He asks for only one more favour: that the Characters quietly contact Kristyn Gebauer and ask her to meet him in Auerswald.</p><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/spot-crossed-pistols.webp\" width=\"188\" height=\"243\" /></div><h4><strong>Aftermath</strong></h4><p>Depending on how it all worked out, the Characters may have @UUID[Actor.5nUNhvoRVnaBE4hw]{Fassenwütend’s} assistance to leave the Watch, or a letter from her that will secure their sentence is commuted. Then again, Fassenwütend may be dead and the Characters may be stuck in the Watch with @UUID[Actor.xiyFua5KmhBnskjG]{Klumpenklug} for several years. If they saved @UUID[Actor.eKsyvPwY0dDMpO27]{Maurer}, one day, a year or two later, small bags containing @Credit[5gc EACH]{5 gold crowns} each make their way to all of the Characters via members of the Stone Mason’s Guild.

It offers an introduction to the troubled streets of Ubersreik, a fortress-town in the Empire. It also presents the rules of the game in easily understood sections, so is the perfect introduction to the game. These rules are presented in boxes at the bottom of the book, much like the <strong>Tricks of the Trade: How to be the GM</strong> box below. This makes them easy to reference, and ensures they don’t get lost in the text of the adventure.</p><p>To ensure the thrilling twists and turns of the adventure are a surprise, only the GM should read any farther. So, if you are going to be a Player: <strong>STOP READING NOW!</strong></p><h2>Getting Started</h2><p>Making the Rounds is a starter adventure designed to teach new GMs and Players how to play <strong>WFRP</strong>. It has a straightforward plot and skips from scene to scene to keep the pace swift. Each part of the adventure introduces new rules and examples of life in the Empire.</p><h3>Adventure Summary</h3><p>The Characters, whilst enjoying the Ubersreik market, are caught in a riot and later accused of instigating it. Mysteriously, a local lawyer steps in and convinces the judge responsible for the case to let the Characters serve as members of the Watch to work off their ‘debt’. </p><p>The party are soon patrolling the streets of Ubersreik, watched over by @UUID[Actor.xiyFua5KmhBnskjG]{Rudi Klumpenklug}, a thoroughly corrupt watchman sergeant. The temporary watchmen are exposed to various crimes, none of which Klumpenklug shows any interest in pursuing, leaving the Characters to solve, ignore, or even exploit each situation as they prefer. </p><p>Eventually, @UUID[Actor.5nUNhvoRVnaBE4hw]{Ilse Fassenwütend} approaches the party. Fassenwütend is a road warden who claims she can have the Characters’ sentences commuted if they assist her in escorting a criminal to his place of execution. </p><p>However, this is no simple task. The party faces a harrowing night hauling a terrified man through strangely altered streets as Morrslieb, the Chaos moon, waxes bright in the sky and mutant cultists attack from all sides. Will the Characters protect the man, who claims innocence, then lead him to his death? Or will they choose a different path?</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\" class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\"><em>TRICKS OF THE TRADE: HOW TO BE THE GM</em></h3><p><em>Being the GM is enormous fun. Imagine yourself as the director of a TV show — you have a story to tell (this adventure, </em>Making the Rounds<em>), a cast of extras at your disposal (the Characters that the Players will meet, often called NPCs or Non-Player Characters), and as many sets as you can imagine (the various locations you describe). Most importantly, you control the camera — you can frame scenes and point the spotlight at interesting story moments, whilst jumping over the boring bits.</em></p><p><em>What you don’t control is the main cast: the Player Characters (often called PCs or just ‘the Characters’). Your job is to set the scene for them, and respond to their questions. Your Players will need to know what their Characters can see, hear, smell, touch, and taste, and will talk to the NPCs to learn more about the world. You will describe all these things, and act as all the NPCs. Playing NPCs is one of the best parts of being a GM, as you can create all manner of memorable Characters for your Players to meet. Don’t worry about making them too detailed — a well chosen phrase or interesting feature is often all that’s needed to provide the Players with enough to imagine what’s happening. To make this a little easier, the adventure provides a description of all the NPCs, and provides some hints for portraying them. Also don’t feel the need to have everything planned out in advance — a big part of roleplaying is improvising on the spot, and collaborating with the other Players to build a memorable story.</em></p></blockquote>",

The town guards the Grey Lady Pass through to Bretonnia, and is one of the busiest trading centres of the Empire. A mighty, Dwarf-built bridge that spans the red waters of the River Teufel stands at its centre. This impressive crossing connects important trade roads from across the Empire and beyond.</p>\n<p>However, for all its importance, Ubersreik is in turmoil. Sigismund von Jungfreud, its former duke, was recently stripped of his title by the Emperor for uncertain reasons. Those perceived as too loyal to the old duke were removed from office, leaving a power vacuum that’s yet to be filled. Soldiers from the distant capital of Altdorf now patrol the town and the surrounding province. This stirs deep resentment from suspicious locals.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, life continues unabated, and you find yourselves in Ubersreik’s bustling Market Square on a glorious spring morning, searching for a decent breakfast. Unless there’s something else you would rather buy?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It’s now over to the Players. Give them @UUID[JournalEntry.XkP5kukwHbjU6NyL.JournalEntryPage.ybRIKBUQMOHTXq0c]{Going Shopping!} and ask them if there is anything they would like to buy, or if they are just seeking a hearty breakfast. </p>\n<p>Encourage the Players to talk to one another as their Characters and to share their decisions. If any are quiet, ask them directly what their Character is doing, and answer any questions they may have. For all the @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.U4xIUC3CfKZAgVSR]{Marktplatz} is always busy, it is overflowing when the Characters visit, so describe how tightly packed it is. Explain that brightly coloured stalls lie to all sides as merchants hawk their wares to the thronging crowds. </p>\n<p>Make note of the ever-present Altdorf soldiers in blue and red livery who watch on, and mention the aroma of smoked meats, fresh baked bread, and buttery ale that fill the air. Point out the imposing statue of Magnus the Pious, a famous emperor from the past, at the centre of the Market Square. Also note that music plays at the edge of the market and applause mixes with cheers as musicians entertain the masses.</p>\n<p>Characters searching for a specific item to buy will have to hunt for it. Each item can be found with a <strong>Simple Perception</strong> Test. Or, if the Character would prefer to ask for directions, it will take a <strong>Simple Average (+20) Gossip</strong> Test.

If you own WFRP, feel free to embellish this list with the trappings found in @UUID[JournalEntry.sLomXnc8R8518cWN]{The Consumers' Guide}; everything from that chapter, perhaps excluding drugs and poisons, are readily available.</p>\n<p>Those interested in purchasing goods should make an <strong>Opposed Haggle</strong> Test with the vendor in question. Assume all vendors in the market have a Haggle Skill of 40. If a Character wins, the chosen item can be purchased for the Haggle Price on @UUID[JournalEntry.XkP5kukwHbjU6NyL.JournalEntryPage.ybRIKBUQMOHTXq0c]{Going Shopping!} Otherwise, the Character must pay full price, or not buy the item in question.</p>\n<p>If a Perception or Gossip Test to hunt an item fails, have the Character wander deep into the crowds, taking far longer to find the trapping in question. Describe the close press of all the people and the distant sounds of cheering and clapping as entertainers ply their trade at the far side of the platz. Meandering through the busy market also provides an opportunity for a Character to spot Heske’s Dragonglass, a particularly fascinating stall selling somewhat unusual goods.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>SIMPLE TESTS AND DIFFICULTY</em></h3>\n<p><em>When a Character wants to do something risky or unsure, you ask the Players to Test a relevant Characteristic or Skill (see the @UUID[JournalEntry.XkP5kukwHbjU6NyL.JournalEntryPage.5bhGIfxb7VdzK4TV]{Attributes and Skills Reference Sheet}), such as your Strength to lift something heavy, or your Stealth to creep about unnoticed.</em></p>\n<h3 class=\"no-toc\"><em>SIMPLE TESTS</em></h3>\n<p><em>Most Tests are Simple Tests. These tell you if you succeed or fail. Roll 1d100, and if the result is less than or equal to your Skill or Characteristic, you succeed! Otherwise, you fail. Failing can mean things simply take longer, not that the attempt is completely fruitless, as you decide.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: </em>Salundra is searching the market for a new leather jacket. The GM calls for a Simple Perception Test. So, Salundra’s Player rolls 1d100 and scores 43. Salundra’s Perception Skill is 32. Because 43 is higher than 32, Salundra fails in her attempt, and the GM decides it takes quite some time to find the jacket in the crowded market, and asks what the other Players are doing as Salundra searches. If Salundra’s Player had rolled 32 or less, the Perception attempt would have succeeded, and the GM would explain that Salundra spots a clothes stall almost immediately!</p>\n<h3 class=\"no-toc\"><em>DIFFICULTY</em></h3>\n<p><em>Some Tests are more difficult than others — climbing a sheer wall is much harder than climbing a tree. To simulate this, you can assign a Difficulty to any Test. This will either add a positive bonus or a negative penalty, making the Test easier or harder to pass.</em></p>\n<p><em>The following Difficulty levels may be applied as you feel is appropriate: <strong>Very Easy (+60), Easy (+40), Average (+20), Challenging (+0), Difficult (−10), Hard (−20), or Very Hard (−30)</strong>. Test Difficulties are often provided in the text of the adventure to make your life easier. You can change this as you prefer, using your common sense to make your own Difficulties for any Test required. After all, it’s obvious that climbing a tree is relatively easy (perhaps Easy +40?), but climbing a sheer wall is much more difficult (probably Hard −20). The modifier is applied directly to the tested Skill, either lowering or raising the target number of the Test. If a Test has no marked modifier, it is assumed to be <strong>Challenging (+0)</strong>!</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: </em>Molrella decides to chat to the passing Ubersreikers to ask where the nearest bun shop is. The GM calls for an <strong>Average (+20) Gossip</strong> Test. Molrella’s Gossip Skill is 50, but that is increased by +20 to 70 because of the Average Difficulty. Molrella’s player rolls 59. Normally, a roll over her Skill of 50 would be a fail, but because of the Difficulty bonus, the Test is a success, and Molli is pointed in the direction of the nearest food stall. Molli would only fail that Test if she rolled over her modified Skill of 70.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><strong>Heske's Dragonglass</strong></h3>\n<p>One brightly coloured stall stands out in the heaving market place. Near the middle of the hustle and bustle, a striped tarpaulin stands a glass-makers stall. Under the awning, spinning, glass sculptures reflect light in all directions, catching the eye. D jxrinking goblets with twin-tailed comets cunningly worked into their depths stand on freestanding shelves. Between these, fanciful sculptures of monsters, faeries, knights, and dragons prowl. </p>\n<p>This is Heske’s Dragonglass, and it doesn’t take an Evaluate Test to instantly recognise the works on display are those of a master artisan.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/heske-glazer.webp\" width=\"219\" height=\"253\" /></div>\n<p>@UUID[Actor.TZ4421xw2VOuXX1z]{Heske Glazer} herself sits amidst the vibrant glass wonders. She is a statuesque Human woman in her 40s with silver-streaked, blonde hair. Her eyes are different colours: one is bright blue; the other — clearly made of glass — is amber shot through with emerald swirls. Heske will call over a passing Character. Talk as Heske would talk to the Players, using welcoming tones: <em>‘I know they look real, but they won’t bite!’</em>  Heske introduces herself and points out her wares, noting her goblets are as strong as steel. Characters interested in a purchase should make an <strong>Opposed Haggle</strong> Test with her. Her glittering ornaments cost @Pay[4ss]{4 shillings} (Haggle price: @Pay[3ss6bp]{3/6}), but it’s the intricate goblets that are her specialty — they cost @Pay[8ss]{8 shillings} (Haggle price: @Pay[7ss]{7 shillings}) and are suitable for a noble.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>DRAMATIC AND OPPOSED TESTS</em></h3>\n<p><em><strong>Dramatic Tests</strong> explains how well a task is performed. Like Simple Tests, roll 1d100 to determine if a Test is a success or a failure. Then subtract the ‘tens’ number of the 1d100 roll from the ‘tens’ number of the Skill or Characteristic being Tested. The result is your Success Level (SL). A positive SL occurs when you succeed at a Test — the higher the number, the better a Test succeeds. A negative SL occurs when you fail — the lower the number, the worse it has failed. Use the Outcomes Table found on the back page to inspire descriptions for what each SL means for that Test.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Example</strong></em>: Gunnar has grown bored of the market and decides to push through the crowds to reach the entertainers he can hear playing music in the distance. Gunnar decides to gruffly push his way through, so the GM asks for an Average (+20) Dramatic Intimidate Test. Gunnar’s Player rolls 26 against his Intimidate of 63 (43 for his Skill, plus 20 for the Difficulty). The tens number of his Intimidate of 63 is 6, and the tens number of his roll of 26 is 2. So, Gunnar scores +4 SL (6 – 2 = 4). According to the Outcomes Table, that’s an Impressive Success! Clearly, no one wants to interfere with the Dwarf Slayer, and the crowds part as soon as they see Gunnar’s distinctive orange hair.</p>\n<h3 class=\"no-toc\"><em>OPPOSED TESTS</em></h3>\n<p><em>Two Characters can directly compare Tests to see who performs better. Doing this requires an Opposed Test. An <strong>Opposed Test</strong> compares the results of a Dramatic Test from each Character. The Character with the higher SL on the Outcomes Table is declared the Winner, and the difference between the individual SLs is used as the final SL for the Opposed Test. On a draw, the Characters should reroll their Tests to secure a Winner.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Example</strong></em>: Amris decides he wants to buy a new hat. The GM calls for an Opposed Haggle Test against the vendor. Amris’s Player rolls 51 against his Haggle Skill of 48, a fail with −1 SL. The vendor rolls 69 against his Haggle Skill of 40, also failing with −2 SL. As Amris has the higher SL (−1 SL, whilst a fail, is still higher than −2 SL), he is the Winner with a final SL of +1 (the difference between the rolled SLs). It was a clumsy exchange, and neither spoke well, but Amris performed marginally better to win the Opposed Test, letting him buy the hat for the Haggle Price.</p>\n<p><em>Opposed Tests often compare different Skills.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Example</strong></em>: An angry wizard-hating burgher confronts Ferdinand. Ferdinand’s Player asks if he can use the Charm Skill to calm the irate woman. The GM calls for an Opposed Charm/Cool Test. Ferdinand rolls 12 against his Charm Skill of 23 for a success with +1 SL. The GM rolls 34 against the burgher’s Cool Skill of 35 for a success with +0 SL. So, even though the burgher rolled a success, Ferdinand rolled a better success. Therefore, Ferdinand is the Winner with +1 SL. The GM states this enough to calm the burgher down, but not for long…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><strong>The Marktplatz Riot</strong></h3>\n<p>Give the Players time to buy new items, explore the market, and interact with each other and any NPCs they meet. Make sure every Player has the time to do what they want. If any are yet to be involved, ask them directly what they would like their Character to do, and make time to answer their needs and make any appropriate Tests for their Characters. </p>\n<p>Once everyone has had an opportunity to roleplay their Characters, but before interest wanes, ask all Players to make a <strong>Simple Perception</strong> Test. This Test determines how much attention each Character is paying to their surroundings as a fight breaks out nearby. </p>\n<p>Characters who succeed at the Perception Test hear the sounds of a brawl over the hubbub of the crowds and are prepared for the fight to come. </p>\n<p>Characters who fail gain the @Condition[Surprised] Condition as they are swept up into a confusing melee.</p>\n<p>And then the riot begins, and suddenly everything is bedlam! It started with a troupe of travelling entertainers dressed in bright clothes and various townsfolk seemingly displeased with their latest performance. The fray quickly spread, pulling in all nearby, including the hapless Characters, who are swiftly surrounded by furious folk and their flailing fist. </p>\n<p>As soldiers in Altdorf livery attempt to restore order, the disorder swiftly becomes a riot as the soldiers are pounded on by angry folk from both sides. Soon, cries of <em>‘Altdorf scum!’</em> and<em> ‘Jungfreud bootlicker!’</em> are audible above the din. </p>\n<p>Characters who passed their Perception Test can see brightly painted wagons to the side of the market beside a raised wooden stage. A sign that reads ‘Betse Wooster’s Wondrous Cavalcade!’ hangs above this.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>BETSE WOOSTER’S WONDROUS CAVALCADE (BWWC)</em></h3>\n<p><em>The BWWC is a group of travelling entertainers lead by the unstoppably charming Halfling showman Betse Wooster. The Wondrous Cavalcade attempts to bring cheer to those in desperate need, and it regularly passes through Ubersreik as it travels the length and breadth of the Reikland entertaining those with coin to spare.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It’s time for your first combat. Combat in <strong>WFRP</strong> is fast and furious, but also simple, as it’s all handled with a single dice roll for each Character involved. Provide the @UUID[JournalEntry.XkP5kukwHbjU6NyL.JournalEntryPage.vRBnsTqZnNwtGt7h]{Combat Summary Reference Sheet} to the Players so they can read how it works if they wish to.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>COMBAT</em></h3>\n<p><em>When Combat begins, we zoom into the action, and give each Character a Turn to do something every Round, using dice to determine who gets hurt, and who doesn’t.</em></p>\n<h3 class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\" style=\"text-transform:uppercase\"><em>INITIATIVE</em></h3>\n<p><em>To determine the Turn order, combatants compare their <strong>Initiative</strong> Characteristics, and act from highest to lowest. Any ties are broken by comparing the <strong>Agility</strong> Characteristic.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Example</strong></em>: The Characters are caught in the midst of a riot, so it’s time to determine who goes first. From highest to lowest, it’s: Amris (I 56), Molrella (I 43), Gunnar (I 34), Salundra (I 32, Agi 33), Ferdinand (I 32, Agi 31), the Brawling Horde (I 30), then Else (I 29) last. Note: any Characters with a Surprised Condition cannot act for the first Round of combat.</p>\n<h3 class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\" style=\"text-transform:uppercase\"><em>TURNS AND ROUNDS</em></h3>\n<p><em>A Character has a Move and an Action on their Turn. These can be taken in any order — it’s presumed Characters are probably doing both at the same time, and you are encouraged to describe them as one combined manoeuvre. Once every Character has taken a Turn, start a new Round for everyone to take another Turn, starting with the Character with the highest Initiative again.</em></p>\n<p style=\"font-family:CaslonAntique;font-size:24px\"><span style=\"font-family:CaslonAntique\"><em>Move</em></span></p>\n<p><em>A Move involves Walking, Charging into Combat, or Running. As the GM, you always decide how far a Character can move on their Turn. As a loose guide, a Character can move M×2 yards when walking, M×3 yards when Charging, and M×4 yards when running.</em></p>\n<p style=\"font-family:CaslonAntique;font-size:24px\"><span style=\"font-family:CaslonAntique\"><em>Action</em></span></p>\n<p><em>An Action involves figuring out what to do, and then testing a Skill to see if it’s successful. The most common Action in Combat is trying to hit someone with a weapon using WS for Melee or BS for Ranged, but any Skill can be tested on a Character’s Turn.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: </em>Else would like to escape the crowded brawl as soon as possible, so the GM tells her Player to attempt a Simple Dodge Test for her Action.</p>\n<h3 class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\" style=\"text-transform:uppercase\"><em>FIGHTING</em></h3>\n<p><em>When Characters wants to attack an opponent, they perform a <strong>Weapon Skill (WS)</strong> Test (for melee attacks), or <strong>Ballistic Skill (BS)</strong> Test (for ranged attacks) for their Action. Melee attacks are always Opposed Tests, unless the defender has the Unconscious or Surprised Condition. The defender uses their <strong>WS</strong> or Dodge Skill to oppose the attack. If the Attacker scores more SL than the defender, it’s a successful hit. Ranged attacks are Dramatic but unopposed, and hit if the Character passes the <strong>BS</strong> Test.</em></p>\n<p><em>If an attacker hits, reverse the attack roll (e.g.: a roll of ‘25’ becomes a ‘52’) to determine where on the body the hit landed: 01–09 Head, 10–24 Left Arm, 25–44 Right Arm, 45–79 Body, 80–89 Left Leg, or 90–00 Right Leg. The Hit Location is used to see if there is any armour protecting the area.</em></p>\n<p><em>The attack deals an amount of Damage equal to the Test’s SL + the Weapon’s Damage + the attacker’s Strength Bonus (for melee attacks). This Damage is reduced by the defender’s Toughness Bonus + the Armour Points on that area of the body. Any excess is subtracted from their Wounds. See the Injury Reference Sheet for more on how to handle Wounds, and what happens when Wounds fall to 0!</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: </em>Molrella shoots her sling at an Entertainer for her Action, so attempts a <strong>Dramatic Ballistic Skill</strong> Test. She rolls 13 against her <strong>BS</strong> of 39. Because it is a ranged attack, the Entertainer cannot defend, so this is not an Opposed Test. Molrella scored +2 SL, and her Sling has +6 Damage, which equals a total of 8 Damage. Molrella reverses the Test roll of 13 for Hit Location, scoring a 31 — right arm! The Entertainer has no Armour on the Right Arm, and Toughness Bonus 3, so loses 5 Wounds (8 − 3 = 5). The Entertainer started with 12 Wounds, but now only has 7 Wounds remaining!</p>\n<h3 class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\" style=\"text-transform:uppercase\"><em>ADVANTAGE</em></h3>\n<p><em>Combat has a momentum to it, with success bringing greater feats of glory. In <strong>WFRP</strong> this is called Advantage, with each each Advantage token giving the roller a +10 bonus to all combat Actions. +1 Advantage is gained for each of the following:</em></p>\n<p><em>• Attacking an opponent with the Surprised Condition.</em></p>\n<p><em>• Spending your Move Charging headlong into combat.</em></p>\n<p><em>• Defeating an important NPC.</em></p>\n<p><em>• Winning an Opposed Test during combat.</em></p>\n<p><em>• Causing Damage to an opponent without making an Opposed Test.</em></p>\n<p><em>Characters lose all accrued Advantage if they lose any Opposed Tests or take a Wound.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Example</strong></em>: Having dodged free of the Riot, Salundra Charges a Jungfreud Agitator harassing Molli for her Move, gaining +1 Advantage. She then uses her Action to attack with her blade, so attempts an <strong>Opposed</strong> <strong>WS</strong> Test. She rolls 30 against her WS of 59 (49 + 10 (from the Advantage) = 59), thus scores +2 SL. The Agitator defends, rolling 91 against his <strong>WS</strong> of 30, thus −6 SL! So, Salundra wins the Opposed Test with +8 SL. Her Sword has +4 Damage, and she has a Strength Bonus of 3, so she has caused 15 Damage (8 + 4 + 3 = 15)! She reverses her Test roll of 30 to determine Hit Location, which is 03 — a head hit. The Agitator has 0 Armour there. So, the blow deals 15 − Armour 0 − Toughness Bonus 3 = 12 Wounds. The Agitator only has 12 Wounds, so it is defeated. Salundra’s player describes the blade whacking off the Agitator’s head, knocking him out cold with a single blow. Triumphant, Salundra gains +1 Advantage for winning an Opposed Test. As she now has 2 Advantage, next Round she will gain a bonus of +20 for her Action.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4><strong>Round 1!</strong></h4>\n<p>Whenever you start a combat, the first thing you do is determine who goes first. Normally, this is the Character with the highest Initiative Characteristic. However, when the Markplatz Riot begins, some of the Characters may have a @Condition[Surprised] Condition, and that means they are unprepared for what is about to happen.</p>\n<p>So, check the Character with the highest Initiative. (If you are playing with the Pre-Generated Characters, this will be @UUID[Actor.njohRTHP8jMyApA9]{Amris} with his Initiative of 56.) Does that Character have a @Condition[Surprised] Condition? If the answer is yes, move to the Character with the next highest Initiative and check again. Keep doing this until you reach the first Character without a @Condition[Surprised] Condition. </p>\n<p>If most of the party is @Condition[Surprised], it’s possible the Characters you control in this combat, the @UUID[Actor.7QQKx2Mp5OxhWinJ]{Brawling Horde}, with its Initiative of 30, will be acting first! </p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/brawling-horde.webp\" width=\"235\" height=\"238\" /></div>\n<p>Taking the @UUID[Actor.7QQKx2Mp5OxhWinJ]{Brawling Horde} into account, you have the following Initiative order: @UUID[Actor.njohRTHP8jMyApA9]{Amris}, @UUID[Actor.NH9yZnUFgSzMTKjz]{Molrella}, @UUID[Actor.qbWReZE7UL1p6JXG]{Gunnar}, @UUID[Actor.Z5D8INeGdPo4esse]{Salundra}, @UUID[Actor.VdDotfA5zyWYdtwc]{Ferdinand}, the @UUID[Actor.7QQKx2Mp5OxhWinJ]{Brawling Horde} (your Characters!), then lastly Else.</p>\n<p>Make a point of telling the Players that everyone in the crowd is fighting with their fists, not weapons, even though some are clearly armed. The Characters can certainly choose to use their weapons, but if they do so in earnest, such an act will have serious repercussions in the next part of the adventure. The crowd acts very differently if a Character draws a weapon. Most act fearful and immediately try to Dodge and flee from a weapon-wielding maniac. </p>\n<p>Further, if @UUID[Actor.VdDotfA5zyWYdtwc]{Ferdinand} casts a spell, it causes a visible shockwave of terrified folk desperately scrambling away from him with cries of ‘<em>Witch</em>!’ As the PCs are first swept into the fight, they all find themselves each fighting a single member of the @UUID[Actor.7QQKx2Mp5OxhWinJ]{Brawling Horde}.</p>\n<p>In Initiative order, have each unsurprised Character enact an Action. Normally, everyone could also Move, but the market is far too tightly packed for that. Ask the Player controlling the Character with the highest Initiative one simple question: ‘<em>What would you like to do?</em>’</p>\n<p>Loosely speaking, Characters have two primary options: fight or flight. It takes 3 Rounds of successful <strong>Simple Dodge</strong> Tests to completely leave the swirling melee. For those fighting, have them enact an <strong>Opposed Weapon Skill (WS)</strong> Test against a member of the Brawling Horde. If the Players lower any opponent to 0 Wounds, the opponent collapses to the ground Unconscious, and a new brawler immediately takes the old one’s place.</p>\n<p>Of course, Players may have other ideas. Perhaps some would like to bully their way free with Intimidate? Or perhaps use Leadership to command others to move aside? Improvise an appropriate Skill to test for whatever plan the Players come up with. Loosely speaking, no matter how they do it, it should take at least 3 Rounds of successful testing to free themselves from the mob.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>Pulling Your Blows</em></h3>\n<p><em>Whenever Characters pass a Test and roll a double (i.e.: a 22, 33, 44, 55, and so on) in Combat, they score a Critical Hit. For this first combat, you should ignore this rule as the Brawling Horde is Pulling its Blows, meaning the mob is not actively trying to kill anyone. However, if any of the Characters wish to seriously harm the rioters, let them use the Critical Hit Rules as normal.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4><strong>Round 2 Onwards...</strong></h4>\n<p>At the start of Round 2, a nearby merchant’s cart full of pies is utterly smashed and its contents spill across the street where the Characters are fighting, turning a portion of the Marktplatz into a slick sea. Pie smeared cobblestone acts as <strong>Difficult Terrain</strong>, causing a −10 penalty to all relevant Tests for 4 Rounds (up to Round 5!). However, a few of the brightly coloured @UUID[Actor.w9ioCI51pC174bq5]{Cavalcade acrobats} have no trouble flipping about the muck and punching folks as they tumble past. Choose one or two Characters to fight one of the somersaulting assailants. These have the same attributes as the @UUID[Actor.7QQKx2Mp5OxhWinJ]{Brawling Horde}, but with <strong>WS 40.</strong></p>\n<p>All Characters can act in Round 2 as all @Condition[Surprised] Conditions will be removed. Just like Round 1, give every Character an opportunity to take a Turn in Initiative order. Remember to have all of the @UUID[Actor.7QQKx2Mp5OxhWinJ]{Brawling Horde} members you control attempt to strike a Character on their Turn (at Initiative 30). Describe bruised soldiers in red and blue screaming impotently for order, Cavalcade entertainers lashing out in fury, Jungfreud supporters with blue and silver armbands throwing punches to left and right, and any other assailant you feel appropriate. It’s a chaotic mess.</p>\n<p>Once each Character has completed a Turn, move to Round 3, then 4. Use the combat to teach the Players how Opposed Tests work during melee, and check they all understand what is happening with every Test. This may be a little slow to begin, but it will pay off later as everyone will understand the rules.</p>\n<p>Should a Player find any of the rules confusing, now is the time to explain them fully, perhaps by reading out the relevant combat rule aloud or the @UUID[JournalEntry.XkP5kukwHbjU6NyL.JournalEntryPage.vRBnsTqZnNwtGt7h]{Combat Reference Sheet}., or by revisiting Dramatic and Opposed Tests above or the @UUID[JournalEntry.XkP5kukwHbjU6NyL.JournalEntryPage.PlIfKND66A2k6Z3p]{Tests Reference Sheet}.</p>\n<p>If any Characters make their way free of the central melee, perhaps by use of the Dodge Skill or by defeating several opponents in a row, have them emerge by some knocked over stalls, completely penned in by the fighting. Enterprising Players free of the melee may want to loot these stalls. Have them perform a <strong>Dramatic Perception</strong> Test. If successful, the player finds [[/r 1d10]] Brass Pennies amongst the broken stalls, mud, and pie. Further for each SL scored on the test, they find an additional silver shilling! If you prefer, you could have the Character find a single piece of equipment from @UUID[JournalEntry.XkP5kukwHbjU6NyL.JournalEntryPage.ybRIKBUQMOHTXq0c]{Going Shopping!}, or from @UUID[JournalEntry.sLomXnc8R8518cWN]{The Consumers' Guide}<strong> </strong>of <strong>WFRP,</strong> with the number of SL rolled determining how expensive the looted goods should be.</p>\n<p>When Round 5 begins, have all Characters in the midst of the battle make a <strong>Simple Agility</strong> Test to stay on their feet as a terrified squealing pig (hurled by the Cavalcade’s Strong Woman) goes charging past, sliding and scrambling along the pie-slick cobblestones. Characters who fail gain the @Condition[Prone] Condition and are promptly covered with muddy pie remains and excited pig slobber.</p>\n<p>As the pig rampages, and the Characters are trying to make sense of what’s happening around them, pause to describe some of the sights in the @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.U4xIUC3CfKZAgVSR]{Marktplatz}.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>As an exceedingly tall man in a long coat is fighting several townsfolk, several of his assailants promptly fall over in turn, each clutching their privates. A blow tears his coat and three Halflings in jester garb spill out of the ruptured garment and proceed to kick their downed attackers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A man covered in elaborate tattoos with flame motifs inhales and breaths a long gout of flame at several assailants. One catches on fire and runs, screaming. The grinning fire-breather suddenly lurches and falls to the street with a quarrel buried in his throat. A successful <strong>Simple Perception </strong>Test allows a character to get a good look at the crossbow wielder: a leering Human thug with a single milky eye. See @UUID[JournalEntry.1nxjKAYE9G3Nyk0o.JournalEntryPage.z8MAOtmZvkgFOsEH]{Part 4: Troubled Town} for more on the thug.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A Dwarf on stilts from the Cavalcade, dressed in red and yellow motley, kicks an Altdorf soldier with his over-large, wooden boots.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A minstrel sits atop a large stall (out of the fighting) and plays a lively fiddle tune which a Character with a taste for music will recognise as <em>The Flight of the Angry Griffon</em> , a popular martial song.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On Round 6, Characters who manage to keep their feet should make a <strong>Difficult (−10) Simple Perception</strong> Test. Those who succeed spot three knife-wielding @UUID[Actor.1hzmNCEEYNDPNHoY]{ruffians} menacing an elderly woman in plain clothes. She guards a young girl wearing an elaborate dress. The rogues have manoeuvred their victims into a secluded spot between stalls where they can act mostly unnoticed. The ruffians have the same characteristics of the Brawling Horde, but with <strong>WS 40 </strong>and the <strong>Weapon (Knives) +5</strong> <strong>Trait</strong>.</p>\n<p>Any Characters free from the mob can intervene. Characters still stuck in the melee can attempt to extricate themselves, though it will require a Dodge Test for their Action (the crowds are now thinning)! </p>\n<p>Characters who confront the ruffians will be told to, ‘<em>Mind yer own business!</em>’ Characters who wish them to cease will have to incapacitate or kill one of the three to force the others to withdraw. If they succeed in doing this, the woman is immensely grateful, promising the Characters’ efforts ‘<em>will not be forgotten</em>’ before she and her charge disappear into the crowd. If the Characters do not intervene, the ruffians murder the woman and the girl on Round 8, then disappear into the crowd. Whether the Characters assist the pair or not will have repercussions in @UUID[JournalEntry.1nxjKAYE9G3Nyk0o.JournalEntryPage.We55vwd78WvhLvtm]{Part 2: Law And Order}.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/spot-skull.webp\" width=\"201\" height=\"224\" /></div>\n<h4><strong>I Fought The Law…</strong></h4>\n<p>Have another Round or two pass, enough time for the Characters to deal with the armed ruffians if they have chosen to do so, before a series of deafening staccato cracks echo across the @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.U4xIUC3CfKZAgVSR]{Marktplatz}. All eyes turn to a @UUID[Actor.L0oHLYZcGQHDWKMo]{flame-haired woman} holding aloft a smoking repeater pistol. The minstrel, surprised, plays a bum note and stops playing. The pig skids by on pie-crusts and mud, before ramming into a potter’s stall with a squeal, sending clay pots everywhere. Soldiers in red and blue Altdorf uniforms, and watchmen wearing the blue and gold heraldry of Ubersreik, rush in to all sides. This abruptly brings the riot to an end.

      "Content": "<p>The weeks of Watch duty teach the party that most of their fellow watchmen couldn’t care less about protecting the folk of Ubersreik. The majority resent what they see as a demotion from the rank of Altdorf soldier to a member of Ubersreik Watch. Klumpenklug’s ‘guidance’ makes it clear that he considers the job is about maintaining the <em>status quo</em> , not about enforcing the law, and he openly encourages the Characters to ‘profit’ from their new duties as they see fit. He eventually lets the Characters patrol without his presence, but always expects a full report, which he accepts in either the morning (following a night patrol) or the evening (following a day patrol) at The Raspy Raven. He also expects his portion from the ‘fines’ he assumes the party will collect. </p>\n<p>Characters that continually fail to get the hint will be dragged in front of @UUID[Actor.L0oHLYZcGQHDWKMo]{Captain Pfeffer}, told in no uncertain terms that their performance is unacceptable, and threatened with being found in ‘dereliction of duty’ which in their case, would mean a death sentence. @UUID[Actor.xiyFua5KmhBnskjG]{Klumpenklug} will always be present for any discussions with the Captain, as he doesn’t want any outside stories of the party’s conduct getting to her, the better to keep them under his thumb.</p>\n<p>Despite the situation in which the Characters find themselves, other folk <em>do </em>regard them as the law and, eventually, requests for help find them. Two of the following cases find the Characters, the third they may well seek out for personal reasons…</p>\n<h3><strong>Without A Trace</strong></h3>\n<p>While patrolling along the Docks, a poor boy dressed in tattered clothes tentatively approaches the Characters. He claims that his father is missing. He gives his name as Eugen Pechvogel, and swears his father would never leave his family. An <strong>Average (+20) Simple Intuition</strong> Test indicates the boy seems sincere in his belief. Eugen says his father, Reikert Pechvogel, left their small shack to make ‘night soil’ one night and never returned. Eugen lives in @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.yY5DUbAdKg2MhDva]{Dunkelfeucht}, a shantytown which has grown in the shadow of the bridge. If the Characters believe Eugen and investigate his claim, his mother, Maglyn, is utterly astonished that anyone from the Watch would care. She will tearfully back up Eugen’s story, claiming her husband is a loyal man.</p>\n<p>Characters wanting to gather more information can make <strong>Dramatic Gossip</strong> Tests to interview locals — failure suggests that Eugen’s father likely got caught up in something risky and paid the price. A success leads to something astonishing: Reikert Pechvogel is one of many missing. The Characters find that more than a dozen other folk have disappeared along the @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.BQA04SKWoMFPjb7T]{Docks}. +2 or more SL reveals that not just beggars, but respectable folk — dockworkers, merchants, and even two members of the older Watch — are gone! With all the confusion of the Jungfreuds’ fall the disappearances have gone unnoticed — or folk thought they were killed as loyalists. If the party ask @UUID[Actor.xiyFua5KmhBnskjG]{Klumpenklug} about the case, he doesn’t care in the slightest, noting the poor disappear all the time. However, if they bring up the other folk he is surprised, then tells them to drop it, noting it’s likely the missing folk were killed during the fall of the Jungfreuds. A successful Simple Intuition Test indicates that the sergeant knows more than he’s saying — in truth, he knows that at least a few of the ‘disappeared’ folks are ones he helped remove.</p>\n<p>Characters that continue to follow up, despite @UUID[Actor.xiyFua5KmhBnskjG]{Klumpenklug’s} order, will soon discover the majority of the missing people vanished along the Docks, usually near the bridge. Characters who explicitly search the Docks surrounding the bridge should make a <strong>Dramatic Perception</strong> Test. If failed, they draw the @UUID[Actor.QRwasUALpkuwthhS]{Baron’s} attention — the Crime Lord who rules the Dunkelfeucht. The Baron mistakenly believes they are investigating something that she or her men did and sends a group of brutes equal to the number of Characters+1 to ‘discourage further inquiries’. @UUID[Actor.2hPRWLIhwFR203T5]{The Baron's Minions} don’t actively try to kill members of the Watch (that brings too much trouble) but they have no problems beating them senseless and if a few die… well, it happens. Fighting the Baron’s Minions may well lead the Characters to think the Baron was involved in Reikert Pechvogel’s disappearance, but any follow up with the folk of the @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.yY5DUbAdKg2MhDva]{Dunkelfeucht} indicate that he had no enemies and certainly avoided getting involved with criminals.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/barons-minions.webp\" width=\"294\" height=\"294\" /></div>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">@UUID[Actor.2hPRWLIhwFR203T5]{The Baron's Minion}</p>\n<p>If the Perception Test is successful, the Characters discover an ‘abandoned’ rowing boat tied to a rickety pier. Part of the boat is torn asunder, as if something with great strength pulled at it. 2+ SL leads to a dock nearby where clearly some sort of scuffle occurred. Huge claw marks gouge the wood. A portion of the stone and wood are fused together, as if something had melted them… An <strong>Easy (+40) Simple Lore (Trolls)</strong> Test indicates that it looks exactly like the effects of Troll Vomit.</p>\n<p>Persistent Characters will eventually conclude the culprit is likely some kind of monster, probably a Troll. They are correct. There is a vile and atypically shrewd @UUID[Actor.22a2dbRVvo7bFk8u]{River Troll} lurking in the Teufel beneath the centre of the bridge. It strikes only at night when there are no witnesses. However, nobody believes this — everyone knows Trolls are stupid. Surely someone would’ve seen it; don’t they have better things to do than chase ridiculous rumours? The Characters will have to come up with a plan to lure the Troll. Bait that appeals to a Troll’s sensibilities may work (generally living creatures without hard or spiky bits that cause it indigestion), as may other reasonable plans. The perceptive and devious Troll only emerges on moonless nights, the better to creep about unseen.</p>\n<p>Any fight with @UUID[Actor.22a2dbRVvo7bFk8u]{The Teufel Terror} will occur somewhere along the @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.BQA04SKWoMFPjb7T]{Teubrücke}, at night, on slick cobblestones or on a sodden wood pier, with the sounds of the river rushing by. There will be fog, obscuring vision, making any ranged attacks <strong>Difficult</strong> (–10 to hit). Emphasise how challenging it is to see, straining to hear any sound, such as the tell-tale scrape of claws, over the murmuring river. </p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/teufel-terror.webp\" width=\"278\" height=\"258\" /></div>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">@UUID[Actor.22a2dbRVvo7bFk8u]{The Teufel Terror}</p>\n<p>The Terror uses a rusty sharpened anchor as a weapon, along with his fanged maw. It will fight until reduced to 20 Wounds or fewer, or it has managed to kill a Character. It will then promptly flee, leaping into the river to swim away, dragging a corpse along with it for a midnight feast.</p>\n<p>Even if the party fails to kill the River Troll, but at least wound it, witnesses to the combat (they emerge with the sounds of fighting to see what’s happening by the river) will cause folk to believe them. @UUID[Actor.L0oHLYZcGQHDWKMo]{Captain Pfeffer} (and even Klumpenklug) will suddenly take their report seriously. More soldiers will be stationed near the bridge and the Teufel Terror will soon move on, perhaps to trouble the party another day. If they manage to actually kill the @UUID[Actor.22a2dbRVvo7bFk8u]{River Troll}, the Characters’ respect among the folk of Ubersreik see a great improvement. If the Slayer Hrolfsson was involved in killing the Troll, his fellow Dwarfs will treat him different publicly, nodding their respect when he passes (which will also help with the next case).</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 class=\"no-toc\" style=\"text-transform:uppercase;text-align:center\"><em><strong>The Terror</strong></em></h3>\n<p><em>The Teufel Terror is a terrible creature, quite capable of killing an entire party if it is lucky. This is the first combat where the enemy will be actively trying to kill the Characters.

Indeed, this fight is so nasty, that some GMs may prefer to skip it entirely… Also, it’s worth noting that the Troll’s Regenerate Trait can be stopped with fire, a fact any Character with Lore (Trolls) will know without testing.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><strong>A Secure Deal</strong></h3>\n<p>One night, while the party is off-duty at a tavern, a merchant, @UUID[Actor.5Ddr1e3STy9bpr3r]{Kurlass Meingot}, asks if he can buy them a round of drinks and discuss a ‘small matter’. His reasons for approaching the party vary by their previous actions. If they’ve helped people, he’ll note the word about town on them is that they might actually care when people are being abused. Otherwise, he may allude to their situation and his awareness that they ‘know a bit more about how the world works than most folk’.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/kurlass-meingot.webp\" width=\"251\" height=\"278\" /></div>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">@UUID[Actor.5Ddr1e3STy9bpr3r]{Kurlass Meingot}</p>\n<h4><strong>The Scam</strong></h4>\n<p>@UUID[Actor.5Ddr1e3STy9bpr3r]{Kurlass} claims he believes he, along with some of his fellow merchants, are being scammed. He explains that @UUID[Actor.zERScZmW5GTpuJjW]{Barlin Silverbeard}, a Dwarf merchant, has talked them into pooling their money to take advantage of a fantastic bargain on Dwarf-wrought forge work from @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-archives1.archives1-journals.li0hUcXJfRWyiaBB]{Karak Azgaraz} in the @UUID[JournalEntry.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.w0YfGxsBuLoODCgc]{Grey Mountains}. Their money is presently held in a secure Dwarf vault that can only be opened at specific times with the right keys. He and his fellow Human merchants are only allowed to visit the vault when their money is deposited. The vault lies beneath @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.A4x3cKwa1h875OlK]{Dawihafen} on the edge of the @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.vovKNLnGDLEDN5LT]{Khazalgirt}. Kurlass declares that something about the deal feels ‘off ’ but that his fellow merchants don’t believe him. They have told him if he wants out of the deal, he’s free to leave and they’ll find someone else to take his place.</p>\n<p>In truth, @UUID[Actor.5Ddr1e3STy9bpr3r]{Kurlass} helped set up the scam with @UUID[Actor.zERScZmW5GTpuJjW]{Silverbeard}, who is the boss of a small gang of scoundrels who have decided their love for gold is stronger than their desire for an honest day’s work. The idea was to bring in some greedy merchants, tempt them with a ridiculously good deal, put their money in a ‘secure vault’, and then have ‘Goblins’ loot it unexpectedly; at least, that was the plan. However, it was never Silverbeard’s intention. Silverbeard, most definitely <em>not</em> a follower of Ranald, has decided the scam has worked so well, he intends to rook the merchants for all he can, then kill them all in a terrible ‘accident’ setting them up to suffocate in the sealed air-tight vault. Kurlass overheard just enough of the Dwarf ’s plan to realise what he is up to, but doesn’t exactly want to tell the merchants that he set them up to be robbed, but doesn’t want to see them dead (after all, dead marks can’t be conned again). So, he has approached the Characters. Meingot knows all con jobs are delicate, so he is bringing the Characters into the equation to throw it all off. Once the Characters start asking questions, he intends to contact Silverbeard, say the Watch is looking into matters, and suggest they give the merchants their money back, claiming the deal is off because of trouble with the Dwarf clans of @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-archives1.archives1-journals.li0hUcXJfRWyiaBB]{Karak Azgaraz}.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Actor.5Ddr1e3STy9bpr3r]{Meingot} underestimates what @UUID[Actor.zERScZmW5GTpuJjW]{Silverbeard} is prepared to do to secure the gold. The ruthless gang boss will move swiftly if he thinks the Watch are on to him — he has already concluded that Meingot is ‘soft’ and no longer listens to him. Silverbeard will invite the merchants to a special meeting, implying that he has secured an even better deal and that their present funds are sufficient to acquire the forge work. He will then bring the merchants to the vault without Meingot so that they can sign the ‘final’ contract. Silverbeard’s contract has several small sections in Khazalid, the Dwarf language, that the merchants can’t read. He notes this is a ‘mere formality’ required in Dwarf contracts. This is a lie. The Khazalid paragraphs actually set out clauses for what happens to the funds in the event of any of the principles’ deaths. Once the contract is signed, the ‘accident’ will occur sealing the merchants in the air-tight vault, which cannot be opened till the next day.</p>\n<p>Meingot gives the Characters the names of the four merchants involved in the deal and where to find them on the Docks: Kahl Trubald, Hitzkoph Hinfaller, Theda Juwelier, and Emagunda Handler. Trubald is an utterly hairless man, who regularly deals in weaponry. Hinfaller seems to be furious at the world, and has an eternally red face. Juwelier prefers to deal in precious metals. Handler comes from a long line of merchants who will trade anything if the price is right. All of them are very defensive and exceedingly greedy, even for Reikland merchants. If questioned, they will get angry at the Characters’ intrusion. </p>\n<p>They then explain that @UUID[Actor.5Ddr1e3STy9bpr3r]{Kurlass Meingot} is a liar and a cheat, and that @UUID[Actor.zERScZmW5GTpuJjW]{Silverbeard} discovered the man was a follower of Ranald who was looking to swindle them all. Looking into Meingot’s history is an impossible task. All that a Character can discover about him is that Meingot is a merchant who comes and goes from Ubersreik occasionally. If the Characters have the favour of the Crosses due to the events of a @UUID[.zm7OiFjYdcQ76OdN#a-conflict-of-colours]{Conflict of Colours} in @UUID[.zm7OiFjYdcQ76OdN]{Part 3}, they can confirm that Meingot is a con man, but a very faithful one.</p>\n<p>Investigating @UUID[Actor.zERScZmW5GTpuJjW]{Silverbeard} is tricky. The Watch does not operate in the @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.A4x3cKwa1h875OlK]{Dawihafen}. Fortunately, if Gunnar Hrolfsson is present, or if the @UUID[Actor.22a2dbRVvo7bFk8u]{Teufel Terror} is slain, the Characters receive a relatively warm reception from the Dwarfs, who will talk. A successful <strong>Dramatic Gossip </strong>Test reveals where Silverbeard lives, and that he has a dishonourable reputation. Two or more Success Levels also confirms Silverbeard actively despises Humans, so would not engage in any beneficial trade with them. If Silverbeard is confronted, he’ll speak for a time to assess the Characters and then choose one of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>He claims innocence, stating he was taken in by @UUID[Actor.5Ddr1e3STy9bpr3r]{Kurlass Meingot}.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>He offers a hefty bribe of @Credit[15ss EACH]{15 silver shillings} per Character to move on.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>He argues he is the aggrieved party, then later attacks the Characters along with his gang. Silverbeard brings a number of his @UUID[Actor.h5l5gOwuMlsDX8oG]{Throng} equal to the number of Characters+2. If Silverbeard goes down, his thugs immediately flee. If the fight turns against the Characters, Meingot will appear from the shadows to provide help.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If @UUID[Actor.xiyFua5KmhBnskjG]{Klumpenklug} is involved, he will take @UUID[Actor.zERScZmW5GTpuJjW]{Silverbeard’s} bribe and walk away without a second thought, suggesting the Characters do the same.</p>\n<div style=\"display:flex;justify-content:space-evenly;flex-wrap:wrap\">\n<div style=\"display:flex;flex-direction:column;justify-content:space-evenly;align-items:center\"><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/barlin-silverbeard.webp\" width=\"247\" height=\"244\" />\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">@UUID[Actor.zERScZmW5GTpuJjW]{Barlin Silverbeard}</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display:flex;flex-direction:column;justify-content:space-evenly;align-items:center\"><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/silverbeards-throng.webp\" width=\"244\" height=\"244\" />\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">@UUID[Actor.h5l5gOwuMlsDX8oG]{Silverbeard Thug}</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h4><strong>Murder Vault</strong></h4>\n<p>The Characters have three days from @UUID[Actor.5Ddr1e3STy9bpr3r]{Meingot} approaching them until @UUID[Actor.zERScZmW5GTpuJjW]{Silverbeard} murders the merchants. If they fail to intervene, word spreads of an accident in the @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.A4x3cKwa1h875OlK]{Dawihafen} that kills several Humans. Depending on the Characters’ actions, they may merely foil Silverbeard’s plans for a time, but save the merchants, who might now despise the Characters for interfering in their business. Savvy Characters may choose to shadow the merchants, following them to the vault to catch Silverbeard red-handed. </p>\n<p>The vault is a special Dwarf construction; it only opens at noon when presented with two unique keys and it closes approximately 30 minutes later. It cannot be reopened till the following day. The merchants’ have invested 100 GC with the ruthless Dwarf. If the Characters are ruthless themselves and end up acquiring the gold without saving the merchants, @UUID[Actor.5Ddr1e3STy9bpr3r]{Meingot} will learn of their duplicity and will not stop until he sees them punished for their crimes.</p>\n<h3><strong>Dramatic Currency</strong></h3>\n<p>The party may be very interested to discover who killed Fosten the Fiery. This will take a <strong>Hard (−20) Simple Gossip </strong>Test at the @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.U4xIUC3CfKZAgVSR]{Marktplatz}. Failure means the Characters hear a dozen variations of who was responsible (including themselves, as some folks still maintain they were the culprits) with no real answers. Success eventually finds someone who recalls the interference of one @UUID[Actor.85VYonGWBcHJReZc]{Einauge Spaltmann}.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/einauge-splatmann.webp\" width=\"240\" height=\"238\" /></div>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">@UUID[Actor.85VYonGWBcHJReZc]{Einauge Spaltmann}</p>\n<h4><strong>Keeping an Eye Out</strong></h4>\n<p>Benedict Gurkenfeld hired Spaltmann to incite the crowd against the performers in Betse Wooster’s Wondrous Cavalcade. The actor-owner of the @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.szPqoGEOOQQ308mU]{Theatre Varieté}, Gurkenfeld imagined some thrown tomatoes and perhaps a few scuffles, not a massive brawl and murder! If the Characters pay silver, they can have folk watch the @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.BQA04SKWoMFPjb7T]{Docks} for @UUID[Actor.85VYonGWBcHJReZc]{Spaltmann’s} return to Ubersreik. Spaltmann is a dangerous man, but by his own rough code of ‘ethics’ he never sells out a customer, so he will not implicate Gurkenfeld. And, if confronted, he will not go quietly.</p>",

The Characters are standing near the @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.ZIp8EucvZLoWbxV9]{Watch Barracks} in the @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.iuChMNeuKpG8Hy91]{Precinct} District, escorted there by soldiers after the court case. Before she leaves, Osanna pauses and regards the party: ‘<em>I realise you feel unfairly punished, but my Lady works in mysterious ways. Perhaps you are exactly where you are supposed to be. What you make of this… experience, is up to you</em>.’ She notes her office is in the east end of the @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.lMkiSBk0fM2nkGZv]{Merchant Quarter}, ‘<em>a stone’s throw from Morgenzeit money</em>’ should they have need of her services again.</p>\n<h3><strong>You're In The Watch Now!</strong></h3>\n<p>Several watchmen emerge to escort the Characters into the barracks. As they approach, Altdorf halberdiers escorting the party clearly recognise them and the ribbing begins. ‘<em>Liking your new post there, Constance?’ ‘You look <strong>good </strong>in Ubersreik colours, Wilhelm</em>.’ And so on. The watchmen, clearly angry, can’t stop themselves from responding: ‘<em>Don’t you have anything better to do? Get killed by Greenskins, maybe</em>?’</p>\n<p>With little ceremony, they haul the Characters inside, clearly sizing them up with uncertain expressions before depositing them (still in their manacles) in front of a door that any with the ability to read can see says ‘Kaptain’. A clear voice emerges from inside. ‘<em>Come in</em>.’  Watch Captain @UUID[Actor.L0oHLYZcGQHDWKMo]{Andrea Pfeffer} is awaiting the Characters inside a large office. The Captain isn’t sitting behind her desk, she’s leaning backwards against it as she stands in front of it, facing the party. The Characters recognise her as the woman who arrested them the previous day. The Characters can make <strong>Dramatic Lore (Empire)</strong> Tests to see if they’ve heard anything about the Captain. Success means they know that she’s been newly appointed Captain of the Watch since the fall of the von Jungfreuds. Greater success levels indicate they’ve heard she comes from a long line of soldiers from Middenland, though she arrived with the Altdorf State Army. </p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/andrea-pfeffer.webp\" width=\"236\" height=\"236\" /></div>\n<p>@UUID[Actor.L0oHLYZcGQHDWKMo]{Captain Pfeffer} introduces herself and indicates the party should do likewise. As each of the Characters makes their introductions, she unlocks their manacles while looking them in the eyes. If @UUID[Actor.Z5D8INeGdPo4esse]{Salundra} is present, she is more respectful, but not overly so, as Captain Pfeffer is a noble herself, though she doesn’t mention this. Once introductions are over, the Captain shakes her head, looking somewhat perplexed. Read or paraphrase the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘We live in strange times. I ask for Watchmen, and I get… you. You may notice my troops’ morale is low. But that’s no surprise, they’re the worst lowlife scum of Altdorf given uniforms, and they think they’re too good for this posting and resent every moment of it.’ Pfeffer pauses as someone knocks on the door and she calls them in. ‘Ah, right on time. This is Sergeant Rudi Klumpenklug. He’ll be in charge of you during your time with the Watch. His account of your behaviour is what keeps you from being executed for dereliction of duty — I suggest you stay in his good graces. I am not a fool. Do not treat me as one and we’ll get along famously. Do as the sergeant tells you, do not embarrass the Watch, and be wary — Ubersreik is full of mischief of late. May Ulric watch out for you… Sigmar and Verena as well. Dismissed.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>Playing All The NPCs</em></h3>\n<p><em>As the GM, it’s your job to portray every NPC, whether that’s an idealistic captain of the watch, a world-weary judge, or a conniving monster like @UUID[Actor.xiyFua5KmhBnskjG]{Klumpenkrug}. Keeping each Character unique and interesting is a fun challenge. Some GMs practice different accents or voices, perhaps taking inspiration from movies or television, copying the intonations of appropriate Characters. Others adopt different mannerisms, perhaps biting their lips for one Character, or constantly frowning for another. Alternatively, you could try props for different Characters, wearing glasses, different hats, or holding a characterful item in your hands. There is no correct way to best play your NPCs. Experiment with what works best for you and ensures the Players understand they are dealing with very different people with their own motivations, hopes, and dreams.

The air is filled with swirling smoke and the taproom is (barely) lit with the thin light of a few wall sconces and individual candles on a few tables. @UUID[Actor.xiyFua5KmhBnskjG]{Klumpenklug} waves the party into an alcove partially obscured by a curtain and calls for a round of drinks from a barmaid he knows by name (Ethelind). When playing Klumpenklug, do your best to be endearing. The goal is to have the majority of the party liking their new sergeant, which will make his future behaviour that much more difficult to accept. Klumpenklug relates some version of the following information in conversation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘There’s two Ubersreiks you see. There’s the one you know, the day one, and another one entirely in the night. The Jungfreuds did their best to keep the shadows quiet, but they’re gone now. And all sorts of things have stirred up. Folks up and vanishing, moving on elsewhere, or “down the Teufel” as we like to say, meaning not breathing as they go, eh? Now it’s our job to look after the shoddy side of Ubersreik. We won’t be patrolling the Hill, oh no, Morgenseite’s not for the likes of us. Nah, it’s the Docks and the dregs for us. Whenever you’re in the Precinct, keep a sharp eye out, too. Be wary of large groups of Altdorfers. They’re trouble. Most of my mates from the watch, they’re gone now… or on the wall with the rest of the loyalists. Other than me and the Captain, and a few other trustworthy sorts, you’re on your own. I’ll patrol with you for a bit, show you your duties and such.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After a pleasant evening, Klumpenklug tells the party to get a good night’s rest and meet him the next day in the mid-morning near the @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.UtDzFPhCEkeMyMRe]{Customs House}. <em>‘There was a time you’d be either day or night patrol. Not anymore. Three by day, then three by night, now.’</em></p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>Branching Paths</em></h3>\n<p><em>So far, Making the Rounds has progressed linearly, one scene leading to the next.

He points out various back alleys where criminals linger at night, noting several spots where people were horribly murdered. Describe some of the businesses along the @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.BQA04SKWoMFPjb7T]{Docks} noting the pervading smell of fish and the river. </p>\n<p>The slums in north-western portion of Ubersreik near @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.Exvp9RN8shcIHrFm]{Black Rock} are crowded and house a great deal of poverty. @UUID[Actor.xiyFua5KmhBnskjG]{Klumpenklug} warns the Characters to always be wary when patrolling there, as their gear is worth more than most of the folk there see in a year.</p>\n<p>Each of these scenes showcase how the Watch operates in Ubersreik, and just how hopelessly corrupt @UUID[Actor.xiyFua5KmhBnskjG]{Klumpenklug} is. @UUID[Actor.L0oHLYZcGQHDWKMo]{The Captain} made a rare mistake in trusting him, for he was swift to condemn the Jungfreuds; he reminded her of a beloved uncle, and she is hard-pressed for experienced help. </p>\n<p>Between the scenes, describe the Characters going about their lives and the generally repetitious and tedious work of regular patrolling Ubersreik by day and night. If you own a copy of <strong>WFRP </strong>rulebook, you could also run some @UUID[JournalEntry.gLDW6JBuoYuzCoya]{Between Adventures} scenes to show the passage of time.</p>\n<h3><strong>Petty Crimes &amp; Dubious Fines</strong></h3>\n<p>While passing through a small market along the Docks during a day patrol, have the Characters make a Simple Perception Test. Whoever succeeds notices a pickpocket cutting a purse and can act before she slips away into the crowd. After a quick chase, the thief is easily caught by whichever Character gets the most SLs on a <strong>Dramatic Athletics</strong> Test. Sergeant Klumpenklug wheezes up. ‘<em>Well done</em>!’  Then proceeds to take half of the thief ’s proceeds, which he pockets himself, before returning the bag to the owner. ‘<em>Spot fine, that is, for leaving your bag unguarded</em>.’ If the Characters negatively comment or challenge Klumpenklug, he’ll sharply note, ‘<em>She would’ve ’ad none of it, if we hadn’t caught ’er.’</em> He’ll then pass a @Credit[1ss EACH]{shilling} to each character from the bag with a wink...</p>\n<h3><strong>Fire!</strong></h3>\n<p>As the Characters are patrolling through the docks late in the evening, they smell smoke. Rounding a corner, they discover a butcher shop and tenement building on fire. Folk are trapped inside, and the Characters can hear them calling for help. A large group stand in the street watching the fire and milling about uncertainly. @UUID[Actor.xiyFua5KmhBnskjG]{Klumpenklug} regards the burning building for a moment, then shrugs and walks on, calling back to the Characters: ‘<em>We don’t do fires</em>.’</p>\n<p>If the Characters choose to help, @UUID[Actor.xiyFua5KmhBnskjG]{Klumpenklug} doesn’t stop them, but neither does he pitch in. He soon acquires a mug of ale and calmly drinks it while watching events from the side-lines. Let the Characters take any Tests they feel can help the situation. Examples include making a <strong>Simple Leadership</strong> or <strong>Intimidate</strong> Test to motivate the milling crowd to start a bucket line from the Teufel to help put out the fire.</p>\n<p>Characters may wish to enter the building to extricate trapped men, women, and children. To do so requires the Character pass a <strong>Simple Cool</strong> Test to charge into the fire. It takes 3 Rounds to entirely clear the building of trapped people. </p>\n<p>Anyone inside must make a <strong>Simple Athletics</strong> Test each Round or be set on fire and acquire the @Condition[Ablaze] Condition. If the Characters managed to get a bucket line going first, the Difficulty drops to an <strong>Average (+20) Simple</strong> Athletics Test.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/narbe-ditwin.webp\" width=\"217\" height=\"258\" /></div>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">@UUID[Actor.ZvthiqduALEhSmwK]{Narbe Ditwin}</p>\n<p>Characters that are successful in saving all the people trapped in the building by risking their lives in the fire acquire a +10 bonus to their Fellowship-based Tests for the rest of their tenure in the Watch when interacting with the poor folk of Ubersreik in a non-hostile way. For example, they receive the bonus when using <strong>Charm</strong>, but not for <strong>Intimidate</strong>. @UUID[Actor.ZvthiqduALEhSmwK]{Narbe Ditwin} is one of the people the Characters saved.  He is a lean man with a distinctive scar through his right eye. His left arm was badly burned by the fire. Narbe immediately helps the best he can with putting out the fire. If Narbe is saved, he will turn up again in @UUID[.Kpj26hQNiTXsjijX]{Part 5: The Prisoner and Warden}.</p>\n<h4><strong>Investigations</strong></h4>\n<p>Characters wishing to investigate the source of the fire can make a <strong>Dramatic Gossip</strong> Test. Success indicates that some locals heard shouting and some sort of struggle before the fire began. With 2 or more Success Levels, they meet witnesses who saw heavily cloaked and masked men set the building on fire on purpose, then a brief scuffle in the street, before they fled. The trail goes cold after that until @UUID[.Kpj26hQNiTXsjijX]{Part 5}.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image\"><img class=\"fit\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/fire.webp\" /></div>\n<h3><strong>A Conflict of Colours</strong></h3>\n<p>The Characters are summoned to a massive brawl in @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.XrD7HLaASDeDsVmR]{The Crooked Hammer}. Gert Hunder, the barkeep, is having difficulty restoring order. At a glance, the Characters can see the fight involves a group of Ubersreik watchmen, miscellaneous patrons, and a small squad of soldiers clad in the red and blue of Altdorf. They all fight barehanded. @UUID[Actor.xiyFua5KmhBnskjG]{Klumpenklug} initially prevents any Characters wishing to engage from doing so. ‘Much easier to sort the guilty out when the fighting’s done and arrest the recumbent for ’aving disturbed the peace.’ If the Characters insist, he doesn’t stop them as they dive into the brawl, he simply helps himself to a pint and watches.</p>\n<p>The miscellaneous patrons immediately desist if a Character tells them to stop. Individual Altdorf soldiers fight on until they’ve taken 4 or more Wounds or 3 of them are down. There are a number of soldiers equal to the number of Characters+3. Use the stats of the @UUID[Actor.7QQKx2Mp5OxhWinJ]{Brawling Horde}, only with a <strong>WS 45</strong>. Several of the soldiers are, in fact, members of @UUID[JournalEntry.d8nvgs2H5MmtKhdM.JournalEntryPage.L5gV9pgaWXB3floP#the-circle-of-unmarred-flesh]{The Circle of Unmarred Flesh} and, depending on how the fight goes, may size the Characters up for future membership. Characters can attempt to end the brawl in another way, such as using the Charm or Intimidate Skills. If the Characters bring the fight to a swift conclusion without further damaging the bar, they gain the favour of the @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.XrD7HLaASDeDsVmR]{Crosses}, which could help them during the events of @UUID[.z8MAOtmZvkgFOsEH#a-secure-deal]{A Secure Deal}.</p>\n<h3><strong>Merchant Squeeze</strong></h3>\n<p>The party comes across a gang of thugs trying to rob a merchant being along @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.BQA04SKWoMFPjb7T]{the Docks}. The thugs looked surprised, and the merchant hopeful, as @UUID[Actor.xiyFua5KmhBnskjG]{Klumpenklug} swiftly strolls towards them, Characters in tow. ‘<em>What’s all this then?</em>’  The merchant begs for help while Klumpenklug listens impassively. He then turns to the gang leader. The man looks about and finally says, ‘<em>He owes his dock fees.</em>’ Klumpenklug nods, turns back to the merchant and states, ‘<em>Best for everyone you pay what you owe, friend</em>.’ The sergeant spears the gang leader with a final glance and states pointedly, ‘<em>That’s good advice for all, eh?</em>’ He then smiles, turns, and walks away motioning the party to follow him. The Characters can hear the sounds of the merchant being beaten as they walk away. Klumpenklug prevents any of them interfering. ‘<em>Leave it.</em>’ As they continue their patrol, Klumpenklug states, ‘<em>You want to help ‘im, eh? Messing about in Dockers’ Guild business is as good a way to commit suicide as any, I suppose. They’ll not kill ’im. It’ll all get sorted and the Watch will have our due for the consideration of letting them ’andle their affairs without any fuss.</em>’</p>\n<p>Characters that investigate (carefully) will discover that @UUID[Actor.L0oHLYZcGQHDWKMo]{Captain Pfeffer} knows nothing about any Guild bribes to the Watch, and would be furious to hear about such. It would be very difficult to prove, though, and @UUID[Actor.xiyFua5KmhBnskjG]{Klumpenklug} is very slippery. Anyone who brings it to her attention will draw Klumpenklug’s wrath. While he’ll remain pleasant, he will mark them for ‘removal’ at this earliest convenience. Characters that want to get in on the action will have the sergeant’s approval and they’ll start making a small purse the equivalent of an extra @Credit[3ss EACH]{3 shillings} every week.</p>\n<h3><strong>Rewards!</strong></h3>\n<p>This scene is an epilogue to the other scenes in Part 3, to be run after at least several of them, and maybe after one of the cases from Part 4 is completed. The Characters are all called to a special assembly with @UUID[Actor.L0oHLYZcGQHDWKMo]{Captain Pfeffer} and @UUID[Actor.xiyFua5KmhBnskjG]{Sergeant Klumpenklug} along with a large number of other members of the Watch. Captain Pfeffer publicly presents Sergeant Klumpenklug with a medal and a purse of silver shillings for his ‘swift and daring actions in defence of Ubersreik’. The ‘actions’ mentioned are the highlights of whatever the Characters have done to the point when you run this scene. For example: Klumpenklug led the bucket brigade in putting out the fire and charged into the burning building to save innocents in @UUID[.zm7OiFjYdcQ76OdN#fire!]{Fire!}; or Klumpenklug stopped a huge bar brawl with Altdorf soldiers that could’ve gone poorly in @UUID[.zm7OiFjYdcQ76OdN#a-conflict-of-colours]{Conflict of Colours}; or Klumpenklug discovered the @UUID[Actor.22a2dbRVvo7bFk8u]{Teufel Terror} in @UUID[.z8MAOtmZvkgFOsEH#without-a-trace]{Without a Trace} in @UUID[.z8MAOtmZvkgFOsEH]{Part 4}. He is clearly a hero. Klumpenklug accepts the purse and will add: ‘<em>A bit difficult, this was, while shepherding the new recruits. Still, I’ll never rest while injustice lurks in Ubersreik</em>.’  He then says whatever else you think will make your Players want to murder him and grins hefting the coins triumphantly.</p>",
