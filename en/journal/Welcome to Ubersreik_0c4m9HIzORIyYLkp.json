For Karl-Franz!’</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>— General @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-rnhd.actors.gfSfXHgfqW5QiUxu]{Jendrick von Dabernick}</em></p></blockquote><p>Nestled in the craggy shadows of the @UUID[JournalEntry.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.w0YfGxsBuLoODCgc]{Grey Mountains}, the fortress-town of Ubersreik guards the Grey Lady Pass, the only reliable trade route from the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD]{Reikland} into the Bretonnian duchy of Parravon. It stands in the fertile Lady’s Vale astride the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.CqIczLRZI265nrAR]{river Teufel}, and is connected by roads traversing the Reikland in all directions. The town profits from the never-ending stream of trade flowing through its busy mercantile districts, handling goods from Bretonnia and the Dwarf Holds of the Grey Mountains before exporting them across the Empire and beyond.</p><p>Ubersreik’s roads are choked with coaches, wagons, and horses carrying goods to and from the town’s busy market places. Similarly, its rivers and connecting canals teem with barges, boats, and ships laden with all manner of cargo for sale and trade. News of this prosperity has spread across the Reikland, resulting in a constant stream of folk too poor to do aught but walk heading to Ubersreik in search of work.</p><p>All this traffic makes the town surprisingly cosmopolitan. In addition to a sizeable @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.A4x3cKwa1h875OlK]{Dwarf quarter}, many Halflings call the town home. Humans from across the grand provinces of the Empire can be found walking its streets and drinking its ale. It is also host to a significant community of Bretonnian expats, and even a small Tilean compound.</p><p>Prospectors, hunters and adventures strike out from Ubersreik to delve into the @UUID[JournalEntry.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.w0YfGxsBuLoODCgc]{Grey Mountains}, seeking gold, fame, or infamy amongst those jagged peaks.</p><p>The town’s taverns, inns and less salubrious drinking holes are full of scarred, cynical veterans spouting tales of the violence and misery to be found in the mountains, but most wide-eyed hopefuls are either too brave or too foolish to pay any attention to them.</p><p>Recently, Ubersreik’s rulers, the Jungfreuds, were controversially removed from power following a decree from Emperor Karl-Franz I. This unexpected command was enforced by troops sent from the capital, @UUID[JournalEntry.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.V6tkgQ9A2skppjyl]{Altdorf}, and compliance was mercilessly secured. This occupying force garrisons in @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.Nhd3vUOVqhDhtRty]{Black Rock Castle}, Ubersreik’s nigh-on impregnable inner bastion. Now armed soldiers sporting Altdorf ’s red and blue livery leave there to tour the surrounding land, enforcing the Emperor’s justice with scant regard for the traditions or the wishes of the stunned locals.</p><div class=\"journal-image\"><img class=\"fit\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/ubersreik-unrest.webp\" /></div><h3>History</h3><p>Ubersreik’s first founding is lost to the mists of time, but Dwarf scholars from @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-archives1.archives1-journals.li0hUcXJfRWyiaBB]{Karak Angaraz} claim the town began as a small, fortified settlement of the Unberogen tribe many centuries before the reign of Sigmar, the founder of the Empire over 2500 years ago. Its location on the river Teufel, and its close proximity to a number of Dwarf Holds, lent it significance, ensuring its continued survival and relevance through difficult times.</p><p>Following Sigmar’s triumph at the Battle for Blackfire Pass, treaties with the Dwarfs bound the two races closer together, and Ubersreik flourished from the resulting increase in trade. In later centuries, further treaties with the neighbouring Kingdom of Bretonnia ensured that Ubersreik continued to grow and prosper, its coffers filled with revenues gleaned from the steady flow of goods and people.</p><div class=\"journal-image float-right\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/ubersreik-duchy.webp\" width=\"270\" height=\"291\" /></div><p>However, Parravon, the Bretonnian duchy lying to the far side of the Grey Lady Pass, frequently warred with Ubersreik, mostly over control of the pass. So, while the treaties they signed brought mutual prosperity, they rarely lasted long.</p><p>Ubersreik was ruled by many noble bloodlines through the centuries, with House Jungfreud reigning for longer than any other, and House Bruner not far behind. Some 500 years ago, the ruling Jungfreuds became vassals of House Walfen after a bitter war of succession. In the following decades, House Walfen control over the surrounding duchies became so complete that the head of the household, Wiprecht von Walfen, declared himself a king.</p><p>Though widely decried, after significant donations were made to fund new temples, the new king secured the blessing of the Cult of Sigmar in Altdorf, and so the Holy Kingdom of Suden Vorbergland would flourish for centuries. But this all came to an end after the Great War Against Chaos, and the arrival of Magnus the Pious.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>DRACHENFELS</em></h3><p><em>Despite the veritable litany of enemies that laid waste to Ubersreik down through the centuries — Bretonnians, Greenskins, the Skaven, the Restless Dead — one ancient foe haunts Ubersreik and its environs more than any other: Constant Drachenfels. Drachenfels the Great Enchanter, Daemonologist, Necromancer, and Emperor-Killer, has lurked in the @UUID[JournalEntry.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.w0YfGxsBuLoODCgc]{Grey Mountains} since before the founding of Ubersreik. His foul schemes frequently ensnared the folk of the @UUID[JournalEntry.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.0Cmr0LZ3boLbNt6p]{Vorbergland}. His fell legacy still lingers like a shadow over the town, his name whispered in hushed, fearful tones or hurled at wayward children as a threat or warning.</em></p><p><em>Perhaps the greatest terror he unleashed was the Rift of 2203 IC. It is said that Drachenfels caused a great tear to open directly into the Realms of Chaos, unleashing terror, mutation and madness upon those living near the Grey Mountains. Chaos reigned for a week. The dark, malevolent presence of the Ruinous Powers could be felt everywhere: Daemons stalked the land, the skies bled, and liquid fire burned in the air.</em></p><p><em>In that week, almost all living souls from @UUID[JournalEntry.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.OONgV24fbQ8ZEqSr]{Bögenhafen} to Ubersreik were annihilated. The few who survived were forever changed. Though no-one knows exactly how or why the Rift appeared and disappeared, all live in fear of the day it will return.</em></p></blockquote><h3>Magnus the Pious</h3><p>Two centuries ago, the Empire was broken, having collapsed into uncounted independent kingdoms, princedoms, duchies, counties, baronies, and more. From this shattered patchwork, Magnus von Bildhofen was born. A noble from the city of Nuln, Magnus was not only destined to bind the petty armies of all the tiny provinces into a single force capable of facing an invasion of unprecedented size, but to also reforge Sigmar’s Empire.</p><p>As Magnus led the armies of Humanity north to face the hordes of Chaos, Greenskins took advantage of the lowered defenses of Ubersreik and razed it. When the Great War Against Chaos came to an end, and Magnus was crowned emperor, he commissioned the Dwarfs of @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-archives1.archives1-journals.li0hUcXJfRWyiaBB]{Karak Azgaraz} to rebuild Ubersreik with help from the artisans of Nuln and Altdorf, once bitter rivals. Soon, new walls soared high, linking the still-standing Black Rock Castle to the new fortress of Magnus’s Tower. Buildings were restored, made stronger, taller, sturdier, and a mighty bridge spanning the Teufel was built.</p><p>Within a few decades, Ubersreik was whole once more, though still bearing the scars of its former devastation as old ruins still poked free from the river, and many townhouses used the remaining, pre-Magnus foundations. The warrens and tunnels created by the older Ubersreik still lie beneath the town, and are used by criminal gangs, smugglers, and the poor as they lie far from the sight of watchful landlords and patrolling soldiers.</p><p>Magnus wrought many, significant political changes as he established his new Empire. Noble families supporting the Bildhofens were rewarded for their loyalty, granted new powers and larger lands, while many of their enemies were punished. House Walfen, the self-proclaimed monarchs of the Kingdom of Suden Vorbergland, was one family that felt Magnus’s wrath.</p><p>Stripped of political power and robbed of their status, the Walfens became little more than figureheads, their kingdom reduced and retitled as an Archduchy. What they lost, their erstwhile vassals — such as the Jungfreuds — gained as they capitalised on their provinces’ regrowth, tightly controlling trade and reaping the benefits of greater autonomy.</p><p>In the decades since its reconstruction, Ubersreik’s fortunes increased steadily, as did those of the Jungfreuds. Ores and precious metals were funnelled from rich seams in the Grey Mountains. Trade flowing through Ubersreik brought merchants, traders, artisans, and all manner of travellers by road and river, all of which significantly increased the tax yield.</p><p>This new-found wealth drew the attention and ire of the Dukes of Parravon across the Grey Lady Pass. When trade deals offered by Ubersreik were not considered sufficiently generous, war soon followed. Bitter clashes in the Grey Mountains soon spilled down the pass like blood from a fresh wound, and Ubersreik was besieged more than once. Eventually, a fragile peace emerged, with a treaty signed that recognised neutral territory in the Grey Mountains. But that treaty is frequently broken by both sides.</p><p>This conflict and success bred a succession of strong-willed, politically astute grafs in Ubersreik. This meant that as House Jungfreud’s wealth and military might grew, it consolidated political power to match By the turn of the 25th century, its influence over the province was unrivalled, despite the best efforts of other local noble Houses such as the @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.U5fSG8wDw2ZCLIWG]{Bruners}, @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.hKYVOZhK3VE53P87]{Karstadts}, and newly ennobled @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.w5RHZtZ8jAxYXZ1F]{Aschaffenbergs}. With their seemingly endless source of wealth in the @UUID[JournalEntry.70sJnVPsNmeNnqdC.JournalEntryPage.riRjmMKV9pjP4Xel]{Duchy of Black Rock} and the loyalty and respect (if not outright friendship) of several neighbouring provinces, the Jungfreuds’ status and position seemed unassailable.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>BESIEGED</em></h3><p><em>Ubersreik has been besieged many times, as often by Human forces from Bretonnia or neighbouring provinces as by Beastmen or Greenskins. On a number of occasions, the town has been completely reduced to rubble and ash by conquering forces. Such as when, over a thousand years ago, as Ubersreik’s population was recovering from the Black Plague, the town was overwhelmed by the Skaven. The ratmen destroyed most of the city’s buildings. When Count Mandred eventually relieved the town three years later, there was nothing but smoking ruins remaining.</em></p><p><em>After the sacking of the town by Skaven, Ubersreik was rebuilt with the help of the Dwarfs of Karak Azgaraz. This began a pattern which was to be repeated over the centuries: Ubersreik was threatened; it appealed to its Dwarf allies, who refused to help; the town was destroyed; then the Dwarfs rebuild Ubersreik, and charged handsomely for their efforts. This led to some resentment among Ubersreik’s patriotic inhabitants, all of whom felt they were being exploited by their so-called allies.</em></p><p><em>The most recent instance of this cycle came during the Great War Against Chaos. Ubersreik’s defenders marched north, leaving the town vulnerable to a great horde of Greenskins that poured out from the @UUID[JournalEntry.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.w0YfGxsBuLoODCgc]{Grey Mountains}, occupying and then destroying the town. Once again, the Dwarfs of @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-archives1.archives1-journals.li0hUcXJfRWyiaBB]{Karak Azgaraz} were commissioned to rebuild, but Magnus, ever the astute politician, ensured this would be the last time Ubersreik fell. The Dwarfs constructed high and broad walls. The bridge was reinforced with runes to ensure it would stand for an age. To this day, Grodni Surehammer, the leader of the Dwarf construction team from Magnus’s time, advises on any major works and resides behind the stout walls he helped build. Surehammer serves as a talisman to the local population, a reassuring sign of their town’s strength and the Dwarfs’ friendship with Ubersreik.</em></p></blockquote><h4>The Emperor Strikes Back</h4><p>The latest change to Ubersreik’s fortunes took everyone by surprise. In early 2512 IC, Karl-Franz of House Holswig-Schliestein, crown prince of the Reikland and Emperor, passed a midnight edict through the Reikland Diet to seize Ubersreik from House Jungfreud.</p><p>The Emperor’s army was poised not far from Ubersreik to enforce this political manoeuvre, proving it was no spur of the moment whim or idle fancy, but rather the culmination of a strategic strike against the Jungfreuds, one that completely stripped them of power in Ubersreik, sending them fleeing to their ancestral lands in the @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.A4x3cKwa1h875OlK]{duchy of Black Rock}.</p><p>Whilst the uproar this caused among the terrified Reikland noble houses was pronounced, reaction in Ubersreik itself was mixed, though the rough behaviour of the invading Altdorf soldiers skewed many opinions negatively. The handful of Jungfreud troops caught in Ubersreik were killed, their bodies displayed as traitors, despite the lack of treasonous activities.</p><p>Altdorfer State Soldiers replaced the town Watch and enforced the new rule of the Emperor. And though many inhabitants of Ubersreik remained loyal to the Jungfreuds, few were brave or foolish enough to state this openly, especially as rivals were keen to take advantage, bringing Altdorfer wrath.</p><p>These tensions were mirrored politically across the province, and through the Reikland itself. While lesser families were keen to capitalise on the power vacuum, more astute politicians feared for future stability. After all, if the Emperor could supplant and challenge a powerful, well-established family like the Jungfreuds, what was to stop him seizing the lands of any other noble house?</p><p>The obvious answer to this question was particularly troubling. So, many of most powerful nobles of the Reikland travelled to speak at the @UUID[JournalEntry.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.sVFygKRicWFw6BsT#the-reikland-diet]{Reikland Diet} in @UUID[JournalEntry.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.V6tkgQ9A2skppjyl]{Altdorf}, keen to ensure this travesty of justice could never happen to them. Many also turned to army building — should Altdorf march on them, they would be ready.</p><p>As the nobles scrabbled, Ubersreik’s growing middle class sensed an opportunity for profit and power free from the prohibitive taxation of the shaken noble houses. The Town Council swiftly became the mouthpiece for these ambitions, and was soon promoting a message across Ubersreik of the stability it could bring if the province were instead a Freiburg, self-ruling, free from noble interference, but still answerable to the Emperor. Unsurprisingly, the local noble houses were strongly against this, but few spoke out for fear of drawing the wrath of Altdorf.</p><p>All of this uncertainty exists because the reasons for the Emperor’s actions are as unclear as the long-term political ramifications. Ostensibly, Karl-Franz responded to recent tensions between the duchies of Wallenstein and Ubersreik. Indeed, the bill placed before the @UUID[JournalEntry.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.sVFygKRicWFw6BsT#the-reikland-diet]{Reikland Diet} in the small hours of the morning cited @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-ua2.ua2-actors.KHU4UeFIP5yokI6u]{Graf Sigismund’s} belligerent and aggressive military build-up that challenged the limitations of his ducal rights as a primary reason for his removal.</p><p>However, while there was no love lost between the Wallensteins and the Jungfreuds, none of their backbiting and maneuvering was any different from the jockeying for power and position that takes place all over the Empire on a daily basis. Some speculate the Jungfreuds had simply grown too powerful, given their wealth, holdings in the @UUID[JournalEntry.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.w0YfGxsBuLoODCgc]{Grey Mountains}, and the Graf ’s impressive reputation. Others fear the Emperor is losing his mind, growing paranoid and erratic, or that he is under the sway of corrupt advisors with their own, sinister agenda.</p><p>Whatever the truth, none deny the event has changed the Reikland’s politics forever. Some even fear that civil war could result as terrified nobles marshal their forces to protect their land and holdings from an unpredictable Emperor.</p><div class=\"journal-image\"><img class=\"fit\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/altdorf-occupation.webp\" /></div><h3>Ubersreik Today</h3><p>When the Jungfreuds withdrew ahead of the advancing Altdorf armies, they took hundreds of loyalists with them, draining several town districts as they fled to the nearby @UUID[JournalEntry.70sJnVPsNmeNnqdC.JournalEntryPage.riRjmMKV9pjP4Xel]{duchy of Black Rock}. This left Ubersreik with a population of some 5000 Humans within its walls, alongside a few hundred Halflings dispersed throughout the town, and a further 1000 Dwarfs in @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.A4x3cKwa1h875OlK]{Dawihafen} — the Dwarf district. Most of the Dwarfs are sworn to the lost Holds of Karak Drakeni, Karak Sanda, and Karak Branar, though representatives from still-standing Holds, including Karak Baraz and @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-archives1.archives1-journals.li0hUcXJfRWyiaBB]{Karak Azgaraz}, also reside in Ubersreik, overseeing trade for their kin in the @UUID[JournalEntry.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.w0YfGxsBuLoODCgc]{Grey Mountains}. The Dwarfs mostly keep to themselves, disdainfully ignoring the ‘manling squabbles’ over the town’s status. There are also a handful of Ogres earning pay as mercenaries and guardsmen, or working for one of the Halfling clans. Only Elves remain a rare sight, and should they be spotted, suspicious stares, gaping mouths, and scurrilous gossip follow in their wake.</p><p>The Town Watch is run by the Altdorf military, and is keen to stamp out the vestiges of any loyalty to the deposed Jungfreuds. However, the soldier’s lack of familiarity with the town has allowed crime to flourish. In particular, the Lowhaven Halfling clan, a successful family of mobsters and racketeers that proliferate Reikland, have significantly increased their influence, capitalising on the chaos to replace or acquire extant criminal organisations. There has been some push back against this — in the slums under the bridge, a gang leader known only as @UUID[Actor.QRwasUALpkuwthhS]{'The Baron'} is organising local thugs, thieves, and ne’er-do-wells, mobilising them to resist any Lowhaven infiltration or crackdowns from the Watch. Because of this, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-rnhd.actors.3iFI20RxtZFfygse]{Father Emming} of the Cult of Sigmar is actively supporting the Altdorf forces, calling for calm and unity to see Ubersreik through these troubled times.</p><h3>City Rulers</h3><div class=\"journal-image float-right\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/spot-rat-torch.webp\" width=\"110\" height=\"165\" /></div><p>Without @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-ua2.ua2-actors.KHU4UeFIP5yokI6u]{Graf Sigismund von Jungfreud}, Ubersreik has no formal ruler. Although Arch-Duke von Walfen, the liege-lord of the southern @UUID[JournalEntry.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.0Cmr0LZ3boLbNt6p]{Vorbergland's} duchies, could claim Ubersreik, he is unwilling to do so lest the Emperor turn his wrath upon him, too. So, the day-to-day running of the town is shared between the Emperor’s two primary representatives, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-rnhd.actors.hcAF95tFaOdoZoeF]{Lady Nacht} and @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-rnhd.actors.gfSfXHgfqW5QiUxu]{General von Dabernick}, and the local @UUID[.FZ6VFcaXq1EzHmXF#town-council]{Town Council}. The Town Council is a body whose role had hitherto been largely advisory and ceremonial, but now wields unexpected and genuine power.</p><h4>The Altdorfers</h4><p>The Emperor ordered over five hundred soldiers to seize and hold Ubersreik. Now two strikingly different nobles represent his will in the town. @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-rnhd.actors.gfSfXHgfqW5QiUxu]{General Jendrick von Dabernick} is in direct command of the military forces. The general is a stiff-necked man of average height in his mid 30s. He wears his heavily coiffured hair swept up in blond twin-tailed comet, a gesture as distinctive as it is devout. He constantly shouts orders from beneath his enormous moustache, and is never seen without his privately tailored red and blue uniform, complete with a gilded breastplate, medals, and gold-trimmed, green-velvet cloak.</p><p>However, despite @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-rnhd.actors.gfSfXHgfqW5QiUxu]{von Dabernick’s} seeming authority, the true power lies in the hands of the quietly spoken Imperial Herald, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-rnhd.actors.hcAF95tFaOdoZoeF]{Lady Emmanuelle Nacht}. Standing over six feet tall, she is a strikingly beautiful woman, with dark hair, delicate cheekbones, and a steady gaze that could give a @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.bestiary.XtVkAVgZRIIgrBXb]{Manticore} pause. She always dresses in the finery of a noble fresh from the Imperial Court, her green-velvet cloak pinned at one shoulder with an expensive, but understated, gem-studded brooch.</p><p>While the Burgomeister and guildmasters scrape and bow to bellowing @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-rnhd.actors.gfSfXHgfqW5QiUxu]{von Dabernick}, most of the Ubersreik’s noble households — most notably the @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.w5RHZtZ8jAxYXZ1F]{Aschaffenbergs} and @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.U5fSG8wDw2ZCLIWG]{Bruners}— seek to curry favour with elusive Nacht.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>WHAT YEAR IS IT?</em></h3><p><em>This book presumes the year is 2512 IC, and the reasons for the recent seizure of Ubersreik are directly tied to the events described in <strong>The Enemy Within</strong> campaign. Refer to <strong>The Enemy in Shadows</strong> for more on this. If you wish your Ubersreik to chart the same course as ours, it will eventually become a Freiburg in 2516, ruled by a council of guildmasters and clerics, and will later suffer terrible attacks by Skaven and Beastmen in the early 2520s. Of course, your game may go in a very different direction, especially if your Characters take a direct hand in Ubersreik’s future. For more on this possibility, refer to the adventures in @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-rnhd.journals.MAfRuWyvI1pHjvPB]{Rough Nights &amp; Hard Days}.</em></p></blockquote><h4>Town Council</h4><p>When the Jungfreuds ruled Ubersreik, the Town Council had little influence beyond occasionally advising the duke. However, when the Imperial Herald replaced Duke Sigismund, she declared it was the Emperor’s will that the council maintained the status quo whilst new rulership for Ubersreik was decided. So, the burgomeister suddenly found himself thrust onto a wider political stage, replete with threats and pitfalls, not to mention opportunities.</p><p>In an attempt to consolidate this power, the burgomeister approached Grodni Surehammer, the de facto leader of the town’s Dwarf population. Surehammer felt the Jungfreuds were betrayed by the Emperor, and would have no truck with such underhanded business.</p><p>Currently, Burgomeister @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-rnhd.actors.nfeuQpvBdcemCuza]{Ernst Maler} is head of the Town Council, a large, moustached man, fond of flamboyant hats and hearty fare. He is joined by the guildmasters of six of the town’s most prominent guilds — the @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.FIx69aLJxrJczytP]{Merchant's Guild}, @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.AIMlOScGrg8pmSdl]{Boatmen's Guild}, @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.b7O2qxgkBbDE6ip5]{The Guild of Boatbuilders and Chandlers}, @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.uMTRONU6hKqX56iH]{Metalworkers’ Guild}, Carters, and @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.f4qEdyACbY0OlYJU]{Carpenters' Guild}}. Of those, the burgomeister’s closest ally is Guildmaster Hans Fuhrmann of the Carters’ Guild. Fuhrmann is a large man who spends most of his time ordering others around as he revels in the new powers of the council.</p><p>He has an abiding fondness for Eilhart wines, paying well over the odds to ensure he’s getting the good stuff; though, in truth, he can’t tell the difference from one wine to the next. His fondness for expensive wine and easy living has left him red-faced, fat, and gout-ridden.</p><h4>Cults</h4><p>The Cult of Sigmar’s is the most widespread in Ubersreik, with ten temples and chapels within the fortress-town’s walls; however, most other primary cults are also represented, with Verena’s and Shallya’s the more prominent, both with significant temples built by the town’s largest square.</p><p>The town is also known for its sprawling temple to Katya and gambling den dedicated to Ranald found in the docks, and for its surprisingly large fortress-chapel dedicated to Ulric found in the walled-off Precinct district.</p><p>With the withdrawal of the Jungfreuds, the @UUID[JournalEntry.0c4m9HIzORIyYLkp.JournalEntryPage.FZ6VFcaXq1EzHmXF#town-council]{Town Council} have approached the leaders of the cults of Sigmar, Verena, and Shallya to help organise town affairs, but, as of yet, none have accepted this offer.</p><h4>Nobles</h4><p>Dozens of noble families call Ubersreik home, most connected to one another through labyrinthine webs of intermarriage, partnership and rivalry. Three houses stand tall above the others — @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.U5fSG8wDw2ZCLIWG]{Bruner}, @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.w5RHZtZ8jAxYXZ1F]{Aschaffenberg}, and the recently disgraced House Jungfreud — and most of the minor houses are their sworn vassals, acting as agents to accrue renown and favourable matches for the future.</p><p>All of their fortunes changed when the Jungfreuds were chased from the fortress-town. The fabulously wealthy @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.U5fSG8wDw2ZCLIWG]{Bruners} were best placed to make a powerplay, but they were too busy dancing with glee to care, so it turns to the ambitious @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.w5RHZtZ8jAxYXZ1F]{Aschaffenbergs} or an outside House to make the first move.</p><div class=\"journal-image\"><img class=\"fit\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/nobles.webp\" /></div><h3>Heading to Ubersreik</h3><p>Ubersreik, is not only a centre of trade, industry, and military strength, it also stands guard over the most fertile region in the Reikland and one of the most important trade routes of the Old World. This makes it a popular rendezvous for all types of folk. Further, for those looking to stock up on supplies before heading out on an expedition into the heights, Ubersreik has the widest range of goods in the Reikland, barring maybe Altdorf, making it a favoured waypoint for explorers, antiquarians, and those foolish enough to believe the rumours of gold in the @UUID[JournalEntry.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.w0YfGxsBuLoODCgc]{Grey Mountains}.</p><p>Whilst there are many reasons to visit the fortress-town, for those looking to weave Ubersreik into their existing campaigns, the following provides some sample reasons for any group to head there.</p><ul><li><p>A courier has an accident on the road and is laid up with a broken leg.

The presiding Magistrate is keen that the solution lasts for more than a few years, so is lodging it with the distant @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.ndJS6SUNVpcUc3ax]{Temple of Verena} in Ubersreik. She is looking for someone to deliver the paperwork for her, but both landholders now regret the deal, and are looking to make sure the paperwork never arrives.</p></li><li><p>The State Army of Ubersreik needs new recruits after the majority of the town’s soldiers fled with the Jungfreuds to the duchy of Black Rock. Troops from Altdorf currently fulfill the majority of military, road warden, and Watch duties, and @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-rnhd.actors.gfSfXHgfqW5QiUxu]{General von Dabernick} (see page 10) doesn’t like it. So, billposters are placed across southern Reikland recruiting any with interest to join Ubersreik’s finest. There they will be trained to act as watchmen, soldiers, and road wardens, all loyal to the Emperor, not to the Jungfreuds.</p></li><li><p>@UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.NyS9OLD4uJQh33pC]{Luigi &amp; Salvatore} sells luxury items in its many outlets across the Empire. Little known to most, the well-regarded company also employs fences in all major cities to buy high-end stolen goods at a cut price. These are then smuggled to L&amp;S stores far from the original theft, and sold at an enormous mark-up. With the recent turmoil in Ubersreik, L&amp;S are looking for thieves and burglars to ransack poorly guarded noble and merchant households. They are also recruiting smugglers to take goods to and from the town.</p></li><li><p>From across the Karaz Ankor (the Dwarf ‘Everlasting Realm’), disappointed diplomatic deputations head for Ubersreik. Most of the Dwarf Holds made deals with the Jungfreuds down through the centuries, and word that these deals have ended demands answers. These groups need guides through unknown terrain, huffers to help navigate rivers, and solid Dwarf muscle for support through dangerous territory. These groups will all make their way to @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.A4x3cKwa1h875OlK]{Dawihafen}, and from there make their dissatisfaction known to @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-rnhd.actors.hcAF95tFaOdoZoeF]{Lady Nacht}.

      "Content": "<p>Being a summary of the major events in the history of the province of Ubersreik:</p><h3 class=\"no-toc\">c. −500 IC</h3><p>The Unberogen tribe of Humans settles the foothills of the Grey Mountains. A fortress town, a twin to the first Unberogen settlement of Reichsdorf (modern-day Altdorf), is founded and called <em>Übersreichdorf</em> (Over Reichsdorf). As centuries pass, this becomes <em>Übersreich</em>, and later Ubersreik.</p><h3 class=\"no-toc\">−30 IC</h3><p>Under the light of a twin-tailed comet, Sigmar, prince of the Unberogens, is born. According to Vorbergland tradition, this happens in Ubersreik. Orcs, maddened</p><p>by the comet, come pouring from the Grey Mountains and attack. This, it is claimed, drove Sigmar’s family to retreat to Reichsdorf in the north. This is hotly contested by the Cult of Sigmar in Altdorf.</p><h3 class=\"no-toc\">82 IC</h3><p>A temple of Sigmar is completed in Ubersreik, and consecrated by the first Grand Theogonist, Johann Helstrum. It is the third ever temple of Sigmar.</p><h3 class=\"no-toc\">c. 150 IC</h3><p>A lesser branch of the <em>Frewida</em> Clan of Unberogen Tribe, the <em>Junge Frewida</em>, come to prominence in Ubersreik.</p><h3 class=\"no-toc\">197 IC</h3><p>The founder of House Jungfreud, Odalrich von Jungefrewida, takes Ubersreik, becoming ‘<em>Herizogo</em>’, a title somewhat equivalent to duke. This is the earliest ancestor claimed by House Jungfreud.</p><h3 class=\"no-toc\">828 IC</h3><p>According to @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-archives1.archives1-journals.li0hUcXJfRWyiaBB]{Karak Azgaraz’s} records, Ubersreik population reaches 10,000, which causes the High King to send emissaries to monitor the fast-growing town, and maintain cordial relations.</p><h3 class=\"no-toc\">881–970 IC</h3><p><em>The First Parravon War</em>. Reikland assaults across the Grey Lady Pass and captures a wide swathe of fertile land from native Bretonii tribesman, driving back the local ‘Duc de Paréfon’. However, the land proves difficult to keep as the locals refuse subjugation, instead conducting a guerilla war from the @UUID[JournalEntry.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.w0YfGxsBuLoODCgc]{Grey Mountains}. The Empire presses on regardless, and colonises the area, forming a new province called Grauesland. However, it is impossible to hold for long, and eventually the Bretonni tribesmen, aided by a local warlord named Gilles, drive the Empire from the south side of the Grey Mountains.</p><h3 class=\"no-toc\">978 IC</h3><p>The Human Bretonni tribes are bound together by Gilles the Uniter, founding Bretonnia. The existing lord of Parravon becomes one of Gilles’s dukes, consolidating Bretonnian power on the other side of the Grey Lady Pass to Ubersreik.</p><h3 class=\"no-toc\">1111–1115 IC</h3><p><em>The Black Plague</em>. The plague kills thousands, leaving only a few hundred souls alive in Ubersreik. The ruling Jungfreuds abandon Ubersreik and do not return. They withdraw to holdings in the @UUID[JournalEntry.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.w0YfGxsBuLoODCgc]{Grey Mountains} to avoid the disease.</p><h3 class=\"no-toc\">1121 IC</h3><p>Ubersreik is razed by Skaven who pour out from the Teufel. The town acts as a staging point for Skaven raids for the next three years.</p><h3 class=\"no-toc\">1124 IC</h3><p>Grand Duke Mandred of Middenland liberates Ubersreik. Ubersreik is left in ruins. Later that year the Grand Duke is crowned Emperor.</p><h3 class=\"no-toc\">1221 IC</h3><p>Ubersreik is rebuilt with help from Dwarfs of @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-archives1.archives1-journals.li0hUcXJfRWyiaBB]{Karak Azgaraz}. The Dwarfs also contribute a significant sewer system, large enough for a town many times its size, allowing for future growth. House Bruner from the southern @UUID[JournalEntry.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.mdjl1WxjZLeuSWAN]{Hägercrybs} is installed as the new ruler. The town will pass through several noble families over the next four centuries, before eventually falling under Bruner rule once again.</p><h3 class=\"no-toc\">1681 IC</h3><p><em>The Night of the Restless Dead</em>. Ubersreik’s population halves in a single night as the dead rise. In response, Duke Lambert of House Bruner commands the Cult of Morr to never site its Gardens within the boundary of Ubersreik again. ‘Morr’s Field’ is then established outside the town walls.</p><h3 class=\"no-toc\">1707 IC</h3><p><em>WAAAGH! GORKIL!</em> Ubersreik is besieged by Greenskins. Dwarfs sent to reinforce the town from @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-archives1.archives1-journals.li0hUcXJfRWyiaBB]{Karak Azgaraz} are driven back. Ubersreik is razed. Warboss Gorkil then invades the Grey Mountains and sacks Karak Branar, taking control of the ancient hold. Waaagh Gorkil! joins with Waaagh Gorbad! in 1711 IC.</p><h3 class=\"no-toc\">1714 IC</h3><p>The Bruners finance the building of Black Rock Castle upon the ruins of Ubersreik. Stone quarried from Jungfreud holdings in the Grey Mountains is purchased to build the fortress.</p><h3 class=\"no-toc\">1813 IC</h3><p>The Grey Lady Pass is sealed to prevent Red Pox spreading from Bretonnia into Reikland.</p><h3 class=\"no-toc\">1940 IC</h3><p><em>The Poisoned Feast</em>. The Great Enchanter, Constant Drachenfels, poisons the entire Bruner line of Ubersreik. Most of the other ruling families of Reikland, including Emperor Carolus of House Abernauer, are also poisoned. House Jungfreud marches and quickly takes control of Ubersreik and Black Rock Castle. The few remaining Bruners go into hiding in the nearby duchy of Walfen.</p><h3 class=\"no-toc\">2009 IC</h3><p>The Jungfreuds are formally recognised by the Reikland Diet as the rightful rulers of the Duchy of Ubersreik. This decree causes outrage from House Walfen, who believe they have the rightful claim, having married into House Bruner.</p><h3 class=\"no-toc\">2010 IC</h3><p>Duke Wiprecht von Walfen declares himself independent from the Prince of Reikland after talks concerning Ubersreik break down.</p><h3 class=\"no-toc\">2012 IC</h3><p>The forces of Duke Wiprecht besiege Ubersreik. Eventually, the Jungfreuds agree to swear fealty if they can continue ruling Ubersreik and all its surrounding lands. Wiprecht agrees, takes Jungfreud children as hostages to compel obedience, then moves on to conquest neighbouring lands.</p><h3 class=\"no-toc\">2015 IC</h3><p>Having conquered the duchies of @UUID[JournalEntry.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.sVFygKRicWFw6BsT#sample-reikland-estate]{Böhrn}, Dunkelberg, Falkenhayn, Haalstein, Stimmeswald, Ubersreik, and Wallenstein, Wiprecht von Walfen binds them together under one flag. Then declares himself King of all Suden Vorbergland.</p><h3 class=\"no-toc\">2049 IC</h3><p>During the <em>First Vampire Wars</em> (2010–2051 IC), the Vampire Lord Vlad von Carstein besieges Ubersreik with an Undead host and mortal subjects from Sylvania. Appeals for aid from @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-archives1.archives1-journals.li0hUcXJfRWyiaBB]{Karak Azgaraz} are ignored, and the city is sacked in the early autumn. Duchess Ilona von Jungfreud is captured from @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.Nhd3vUOVqhDhtRty]{Black Rock Castle} and never seen again.</p><h3 class=\"no-toc\">2141–2149 IC</h3><p><em>The Second Parravon War</em>. As Ubersreik troops are pulled by King Adalman of Suden Vorbergland to support Reikland allies to the north in their defence against the Undead hosts of Vampire Lord Mannfred von Carstein during the Third Vampire Wars (2124–2145 IC), the Duc of Parravon launches a surprise attack across the Grey Lady Pass aiming to secure Ubersreik. Ubersreik is sacked twice, though @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.Nhd3vUOVqhDhtRty]{Black Rock Castle} is never taken.</p><h3 class=\"no-toc\">2203 IC</h3><p><em>The Great Rift</em>. A rift into the Realms of Chaos opens at Castle Drachenfels. A week of horror as Daemons walk the earth. Ubersreik’s population falls to just 1,500 from over 15,000.</p><h3 class=\"no-toc\">2302 IC</h3><p><em>The Great War Against Chaos</em>. The soldiers of Ubersreik are drained from the town to support Magnus Bildhofen’s war effort in Kislev to hold back armies invading the Old World from the north.</p><h3 class=\"no-toc\">2303 IC</h3><p><em>Waaagh Zzadrag!</em> Before the soldiers of Ubersreik return from the north, Greenskins pour from the @UUID[JournalEntry.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.w0YfGxsBuLoODCgc]{Grey Mountains} and besiege Ubersreik. @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-archives1.archives1-journals.li0hUcXJfRWyiaBB]{Karak Azgaraz} refuses to send help and Ubersreik is razed. The Greenskins move westwards and invade the Barony of Böhrn.</p><h3 class=\"no-toc\">2304 IC</h3><p>King Zaladrin of @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-archives1.archives1-journals.li0hUcXJfRWyiaBB]{Karak Azgaraz} agrees to help rebuild Ubersreik after meeting with newly crowned Emperor Magnus I. Part of the agreement involves new walls for the city ‘at least 30 Dwarfs high!’ For the next three decades, the exact measurement of a ‘Dwarf’ is bitterly disputed, with Zaladrin once presenting his newborn daughter as a suggested length.</p><h3 class=\"no-toc\">2308–2310 IC</h3><p><em>The Third Parravon</em> War. Parravon attacks, finding Ubersreik’s recent military expansion to support the newly rebuilt town unacceptable. The Bretonnians are driven back in late 2309, and a force led by Graf Haldebrand of House Jungfreud besieges Parravon in return, before peace is brokered a year later by King Zaladrin of Karak Azgaraz.</p><h3 class=\"no-toc\">2401–2405 IC</h3><p><em>The Fourth Parravon War</em>. Even though Ubersreik is besieged twice, the second time for three years, it does not fall. However, the population drops by almost two thirds to less than 6,000.</p><h3 class=\"no-toc\">2420–2422 IC</h3><p><em>Waaagh Grom!</em> Ubersreik weathers a storm as uncounted thousands of Greenskins roam freely across the @UUID[JournalEntry.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.0Cmr0LZ3boLbNt6p]{Vorbergland} largely uncontested as Emperor Dieter IV hides with most of his State Armies in Altdorf. The continued sieges leave Ubersreik’s population at a little over 3,000.</p><h3 class=\"no-toc\">2474 IC</h3><p><em>The Fifth Parravon War</em>. Duc Gaston of Parravon attacks in the spring, besieging Ubersreik. Before the State Armies of Reikland can respond, most of the province of Ubersreik is burning. After sixth months of skirmishes, Parravon withdraws through the Grey Lady Pass.</p><h3 class=\"no-toc\">2491 IC</h3><p><em>The Battle for la Maisontaal</em>. Skaven allied with Undead invade the Grey Lady Pass. They are eventually driven back by Bretonnians. The lack of aid from Ubersreik increases tensions with Parravon.</p><h3 class=\"no-toc\">2495 IC</h3><p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-ua2.ua2-actors.KHU4UeFIP5yokI6u]{Graf Sigismund} of House Jungfreud inherits the Duchy of Ubersreik after his father dies. He immediately moves his court from his estates in the mountain @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.A4x3cKwa1h875OlK]{duchy of Black Rock} and takes up residence in @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.Nhd3vUOVqhDhtRty]{Black Rock Castle} in the town of Ubersreik.</p><p>He soon establishes himself as one of the finest political and military minds of his generation, though he is known for his absolute ruthlessness and dedication to his family over all others.</p><h3 class=\"no-toc\">2512 IC</h3><p><em>Ubersreik Freed!</em> Emperor Karl-Franz I passes a surprise edict through the @UUID[JournalEntry.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.sVFygKRicWFw6BsT#the-reikland-diet]{Reikland Diet} at midnight and uses it to seize Ubersreik, forcing @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-ua2.ua2-actors.KHU4UeFIP5yokI6u]{Graf Sigismund} to retreat to the @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.A4x3cKwa1h875OlK]{Duchy of Black Rock}. The town, and its surrounding province, are left without a formal ruler, although an @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-rnhd.actors.hcAF95tFaOdoZoeF]{Imperial Herald} representing Karl-Franz fulfils almost all of that role. What this means for the future of Ubersreik, and the Empire, is uncertain.</p>",
