Ringed by glaciers, the pass through the centre of the fortified fiefdom is usually impassable in the depths of winter. Though it has been decades since the last conflict with Parravon, the State Army regiment garrisoned in the march is always ready, which is especially prudent given the number of Greenskin tribes making their home in the mountains. Graumarkschlosse, the fief ’s largest castle, is located high on the cliffs to the north of the road overlooking the pass. Entrance is made via a complex lift powered by steam. The pass is littered with the ruins of less fortified castles sacked by Greenskins in previous centuries. Now the blackened bones of these fallen fortresses are home to nothing more than the restless shades of the fallen. The only other settlement of any size is Teuquelle, a frozen village heavily defended with cannons and mortars.</p><p>Margrave Tobias Aschaffenberg, eldest son of Brynich Aschaffenberg, became the ruler of the March after the previous margrave died without heirs. Even though he ruled the province for several years, Tobias had never set foot in the isolated, freezing barony until recently. A quarrelsome braggart and skilled duellist, he preferred spending his time amongst the bright lights of Reikland’s finest festivals with an occasional dip in Nuln’s waters come Blackpowder Week. But when the Jungfreuds lost Ubersreik, Tobias’s father sent him to Graumarkschlosse to put his house in order, ensuring the defenses were unimpeachable to better enhance the Aschaffenberg name and ensure Grey Lady Pass didn’t fall under the sway of another Noble House. </p><section id=\"secret-AbRMCJf5i3itonY6\" class=\"secret\"><ul><li><p>The Grey Lady Pass is home to undying rumours of the Grey Lady, a restless spirit who appears as an omen of impending doom. The spirit appears when the party are stranded amidst the ruins while the lift is repaired. The Grey Lady foretells nothing less than the end of the world before vanishing, never to be seen again.</p></li><li><p>Wandering the March, the party discover a wounded giant, acting aggressively. Should they defeat the giant, and not flee, it will address them with its dying breath. In stilted, childlike Reikspiel, it bemoans the cruelty of fate, and begs the PCs to look after its child. As its dying breath rattles in its throat, they hear the loud wails of a six-foot long baby.</p></li></ul></section>",

The forests are dotted with hunting lodges, and even the seat of the ruling Bruners, Steirlich Manor, is a heavily fortified lodge. House Bruner draws immense wealth from its deep mines sunk into the southern @UUID[JournalEntry.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.mdjl1WxjZLeuSWAN]{Hägercrybs}, and despite centuries of affluence, the mines there show no signs of playing out. The Bruners bought the neighbouring duchy of Karstadt some decades ago from the troubled @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-ua2.ua2-journals.L5jznUfxaHGPjbYc]{House Karstadt}, which brought fertile farmlands and the major road into Ubersreik under Bruner control, not to mention a number of profitable tollgates. The Bruners demanded the Karstadts surrendered their patent of nobility as a term of the sale, which was supported by the ruling Jungfreuds at the time, effectively making the Karstadts commoners. Whilst few could fathom this decision, the enormous success the Karstadts secured when they established a new Merchant House, eventually making them one of the richest families in the duchy, soon silenced their detractors.</p><p>Graf Steirlich rules both provinces directly, though he has many vassals. He, like his manor, was named after one of his illustrious ancestors, and he is a driven and determined man. He regularly rides his land, hunting bandits, beasts, and fowl with equal enthusiasm. He takes little interest in politics, leaving such affairs to his mother @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.U5fSG8wDw2ZCLIWG]{Kisaiya von Bruner} and his nephew, Heissman. But he does love his family, and recently gifted the castle of Ulmeturm to his niece Ludmilla as a wedding gift, celebrating her union with @UUID[Actor.9KRZ40ZvmYXt6gFI]{Rickard Aschaffenberg}, a gesture Kisaiya is said to consider foolish and profligate. </p><section id=\"secret-ol1nLZIur6DGiG4U\" class=\"secret\"><ul><li><p>Graf Stierlich is advertising for staff to assist an annual hunting party in Grunewald Lodge, a small estate in the Duchy of Karstadt.

Emperor Magnus the Pious created the fief after the Great War Against Chaos, and there elevated the Aschaffenbergs to nobility, granting them land once ruled by a minor branch of House Walfen. Most of the duchy’s wealth comes from ore mines and the river Teufel, both in terms of the trade and fishing. In particular, many Huffers (river guides) ply their trade in the town of Aschaffen, helping barges navigate the treacherous waters down to Auerswald. The highest peak in the Blitzfelsen Hills, Taubeberg, lies on the north-east border of the duchy, and is riddled through with Goblins from the Creeping Death tribe. Forays to clear the Greenskins from Aschaffen land near the mining town of Blitzhöhe are an annual event, meaning many of the local nobles have significant military experience.</p><p>The current graf, Brynich Aschaffenberg, is an ambitious man with many heirs. In recent years he has secured for his eldest son, Tobias, the prestigious position of Margrave of the Grey Lady Pass. He also negotiated a marriage between his second son, Rickard, and Ludmilla von Bruner, Graf Steirlich’s only daughter.

This means its duke can sit on the Reikland Diet, Reikland’s legislative body, and that none have authority over the ruling duke bar the prince of Reikland. The duchy contains seven fiefs, which are themselves split into many smaller estates. However, as Ubersreik currently has no duke, the rulers of Ubersreik’s fiefs have no liege to swear to.
