Known as the cross-roads of the Reikland, Ubersreik protects a valuable gateway into the Empire from Bretonnia. As a prosperous trade hub, it also supports a lively service industry, with inns and lodging houses to suit every class of merchant, traveler, or reveler. Similarly, there are shops and trading houses selling a broad variety of goods, both legitimate and illegal.</p><p>The town is so used to outsiders moving through that they are almost always welcomed as long as they have something to buy or sell, or are willing to spend coin. The townsfolk recognize their prosperity is sourced from the free ﬂow of trade goods and people — assuming the appropriate tariffs are paid, of course — so strangers are expected and accommodated.</p><p>Long columns of those seeking access to Ubersreik are common at peak hours in the mornings and early evenings. Fast entry is offered to: those with the correct documents; nobles; wizards from the Colleges of Magic; registered coaches; and local guildsman. Others must wait. It’s common to find hawkers and vendors selling trinkets, holy artefacts, prayer parchments, and local delicacies to any in the queue with spare coin.</p><h3>Approaches</h3><p>As a strategically important fortress-town, Ubersreik is well-served by several primary roads. The main routes into the town are the Bögenhafen Road, Auerswald Road, Nuln Road, and the Parravon Road. The Parravon Road leads through the Grey Lady Pass into the neutral territory of Frugelhorn and then into Bretonnia. Beyond the Azgaraz Trading Post, which marks the junction between the Parravon Road and the road to @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-archives1.archives1-journals.li0hUcXJfRWyiaBB]{Karak Azgaraz}, the quality of footing decreases significantly. In spring and summer, vast trains of 40 or more heavily laden wagons are a common sight rolling down from the Grey Lady Pass, bringing goods from Bretonnia and the Dwarfs of the @UUID[JournalEntry.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.w0YfGxsBuLoODCgc]{Grey Mountains}. However, no matter how busy the pass may be, of all the routes into Ubersreik, the Nuln Road is the most heavily used.</p><p>Most of the trade goods entering and leaving Ubersreik do so by river. The Jungfreud @UUID[JournalEntry.70sJnVPsNmeNnqdC.JournalEntryPage.riRjmMKV9pjP4Xel]{duchy of Black Rock} is connected to Ubersreik by @UUID[JournalEntry.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.CqIczLRZI265nrAR]{the Teuful}, which is navigable up to @UUID[JournalEntry.70sJnVPsNmeNnqdC.JournalEntryPage.2vUSJ8EdMkQ6WYxl]{Shluesselschlossscheucht}, a deep-sided gorge. Until recently, trade shipments of valuable coal and iron ore from @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.Exvp9RN8shcIHrFm]{Black Rock} were carried down the Teufel to Ubersreik by barge. However, with the recent upheaval, the Jungfreuds have chosen to ship along the Hagercyrb canal instead, which has led to a shortage of coal in Ubersreik. Downriver, the Teufel leads to the @UUID[JournalEntry.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.Zhp59VXYiv6dGfhR]{River Reik} and on to @UUID[JournalEntry.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.V6tkgQ9A2skppjyl]{Altdorf}. This navigable link to the capital further strengthens Ubersreik’s importance.</p><p>Recently, the Archduke of Upper Teufel helped finance a significant canal system. Two of these canals connect to @UUID[JournalEntry.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.CqIczLRZI265nrAR]{the Teufel} river: the Grey Lady Canal and @UUID[JournalEntry.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.mdjl1WxjZLeuSWAN]{the Hagercryb}. The Grey Lady Canal leads down to Nuln, cutting out a lengthy diversion down the Teuful and back up @UUID[JournalEntry.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.Zhp59VXYiv6dGfhR]{the Reik}. The Hagercryb, connects first to the River Tahme and down through @UUID[JournalEntry.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.I0krpnI0RnVs5RwK]{the Bögen} to the Reik downriver of Altdorf. Importantly, this connects Ubersreik to Carroburg, and on to Marienburg in turn.</p><p>These canals caused much consternation in the Imperial family, as they enabled the bypassing of Altdorf ’s customs and levies. In an attempt to combat this, Emperor Luitpold III tried to block the building of the canals in the Reikland Diet in 2484 IC. When this failed, he instead tried to dredge the Teufel where it meets the Reik — the marshes in this area are treacherous and notoriously hard to navigate. As a result of Luitpold’s repeated failures to do this, this silty area of marshland is now known as Luitpold’s Folly. </p><h3>Getting In</h3><p>Guarding Ubersreik is a massive, crenelated stone wall. Built during the reign of Magnus the Pious, it was designed by Dwarf engineers to connect to the fortifications of @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.Nhd3vUOVqhDhtRty]{Black Rock Castle}. Troops from Ubersreik’s State Army once manned the battlements, but Altdorf ’s soldiers have taken over that duty for now. Towers, great and small, rise from the walls. The largest are the Helmsweg, Hugeldal, von Voglemann, and Magnus. Helmsweg is considered the ‘luckiest’ as it has never been breached. Hugeldal is leaning precariously, though most Dwarfs snort if any dare suggest it may topple. The imposing von Voglemann tower boasts heavy walls and multiple cannon, but can only be reached by a special lift, making duties there a mixed blessing. @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.tCh9vROs0eeTuEwA]{The Magnus Tower} is tallest of them all, and lies in the heart of the @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.iuChMNeuKpG8Hy91]{Precinct} district.</p><p>Three gates and a river pass through the high walls. According to the original specifications set by Magnus the Pious, the North and South gates are wide enough to allow ‘a whole regiment at march’. They stand open from dawn to dusk, when the great horn on the Magnus’s Tower blows warning of their imminent closure. A single, massive iron-bound, oak gate then closes in each gateway. A sturdy portcullis, a wide variety of murder-holes, and various deadly Dwarf mechanisms line each gateway passage, ensuring Ubersreik’s sanctity. The smaller East Gate does not boast this security, but is only wide enough for two carts side-by-side. All three gates are watched over by a customs clerk and the Watch to ensure all appropriate taxes are promptly paid.</p><p>@UUID[JournalEntry.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.CqIczLRZI265nrAR]{The Teufel} River is safeguarded by heavy towers and enormous portcullis gates — one to the east and west. The portcullises are rarely shut as it takes almost half an hour to winch them up. The lowest story of the towers also contain winch houses used to raise a massive Dwarf-forged chain, with links as long as a man is tall. The chain is lined with enormous spikes and gigantic blades capable of gutting a warship.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"sidebar-title\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>Ubersreik Festivals</em></h3><p><em>The Reikland is renowned across the empire for its many different festivals.

      "Content": "<p>Grodni Surehammer and his @UUID[.wht9BofyQGmtinWN]{Dwarf Engineers’ Guild} designed and built Ubersreik Bridge over 200 years ago. At that time, Ubersreik was little more than a ruin recently retaken by the State Army of Reikland. The newly crowned emperor, Magnus the Pious, was keen to rebuild what was lost, so commissioned his Dwarf allies to construct a new crossing over the Teufel; the previous bridge had collapsed during the battles to retake the town from stubborn Greenskins.</p>\n<p>Two centuries later, and bridge still dominated Ubersreik. It is supported by a number of great, stone pillars sunk deep into the riverbed, to a height making it visible from much of the town. The pillars, tightly grouped near the riverbank, open out in the center, offering two broad channels through which even tall masted river barges can safely pass. The bridge is inscribed with ancient Dwarf runes, ensuring strength and stability.</p>\n<p>Local laws prohibit building atop the bridge, meaning those traversing it are greeted with some fine views of both sides of the town and the river surging beneath. Unseen from this vantage, the homeless gather under the bridge when the river isn’t swollen. There they seek to avoid the worst the weather has to offer. Historically the Jungfreuds periodically swept this largely Human detritus away, though the poor and destitute would always return in foul weather.</p>\n<p>Of late, the Altdorfers have shown no signs of clearing these unfortunates away. As a result, a small shanty town, known locally as Dunkelfeucht, has sprung up under the bridge’s shadow. The Jungfreud supporters in Ubersreik turn their noses up at this development, citing it as yet another failing of the interlopers from the north.</p>\n<p>Indeed, even the most loyal supporter of the Emperor has to admit that any right-thinking citizen of Ubersreik should be concerned at the unchecked expansion of the Dunkelfeucht. It has not only garnered a particularly foul reputation for attracting the very worst folk Ubersreik has to offer, it is also martialing itself, meaning any future attempt to clear the folk from under the bridge will be met with significant resistance.</p>\n<p>Because of this, only the desperate now venture there. Gangs and footpads prowl, and few mornings pass without blood being shed or a fresh body found adrift on the river’s current. Unsurprisingly, the Altdorf-led Watch now avoids the place completely, knowing there is little to be gained by antagonizing the new powers-that-be below the bridge. This freedom from law-enforcement has allowed several makeshift jetties to be built by smuggling gangs. Finding their activities unchallenged, many of these gangs have become bold, often offloading large barges in broad daylight without fear of reprise. Of course, some onlookers mutter that such brazen criminality would never have been allowed when the Jungfreuds ruled, but such talk is divisive, and likely to start arguments, brawls, and even riots.</p>\n<p>Recent rumors suggest the gangs of the Dunkelfeucht are being bound together by a new leader known only as @UUID[Actor.QRwasUALpkuwthhS]{‘The Baron’}. Though a new arrival to Ubersreik, this criminal mastermind is already known for his ambition and utter ruthlessness. Few outside Dunkelfeucht have ever clapped eyes on him, though most Ubersreikers have heard of him and fear him. If rumors are to be believed, he already has scores of thieves, thugs, and smugglers under his control, and he intends to spread from the docklands quickly, quashing any attempts to thwart the rise of his newly forged criminal empire.</p>\n<div style=\"display:flex;justify-content:space-evenly;flex-wrap:wrap\">\n<div style=\"display:flex;flex-direction:column;justify-content:space-evenly;align-items:center\"><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/the-baron.webp\" width=\"217\" height=\"230\" />\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">@UUID[Actor.QRwasUALpkuwthhS]{The Baron}</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display:flex;flex-direction:column;justify-content:space-evenly;align-items:center\"><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/the-eel.webp\" width=\"188\" height=\"232\" />\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">@UUID[Actor.itvpbprrrMzX6oD6]{The Eel}</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<section id=\"secret-DUmMOar9fvWxNuAW\" class=\"secret\">\n<h3 class=\"no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center\">Down And Out In Ubersreik</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The party have been hired by Klaus Osfer to locate his brother Ulli, who is somewhere in Dunkelfeucht.

They met once a month in @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.ddQoNatt6T4Fd2ZY]{The Red Moon Inn} to discuss rodent nests, but otherwise kept to themselves. The Duke of Ubersreik funded a rat-tail bounty, which was just generous enough for them to make a living. But then the Jungfreuds were removed from power, and the rat catchers, bountyless, seemed doomed.</p>\n<p>However, just a week later, @UUID[Actor.rlm60LyBWkTIpOWr]{Wahlund}, a foreign rat catcher, arrived in Ubersreik with his ‘Exterminators’. Wahlund bought an old inn, which he offered the guild if it let him lead them. Somewhat stunned, the rat catchers warily agreed, and Wahlund became Guildmaster Wahlund. His first act was to approach the @UUID[JournalEntry.0c4m9HIzORIyYLkp.JournalEntryPage.FZ6VFcaXq1EzHmXF#town-council]{Town Council} to demand a new rat-tail bounty. The burgomeister was reluctant, but wanted to appear as capable as the Jungfreuds before him, so agreed. Wahlund then printed pamphlets advertising new, higher rates, each containing numerous testimonials from satisfied customers. He then hired a small army of street urchins to hand them out. And then the money rolled in.</p>\n<p>Wahlund’s Rat Catchers, as the guild is now named, is located in a former tavern on Grossweg. Wahlund purchased it from a retired seaman. The tavern’s sign had depicted a snarling, fat shark, so it now has a dead rat painted hastily into its mouth. The old taproom serves as a meeting room and clubhouse for the rat catchers and their visitors. The cellar houses a kennel for their dogs, and also contains a secure entrance into Ubersreik’s sewer complex, which is why the inn was chosen.</p>\n<p>The guild comprises only nine members. It is led by @UUID[Actor.rlm60LyBWkTIpOWr]{Guildmaster Wahlund}, who arrived in Ubersreik shortly before the Altdorf forces invaded.

      "Content": "<p>Dominating the skyline in the south of Ubersreik, the Old Granary is one of the fortress-town’s tallest buildings. The conical construction is entirely built from stone, and has many doors up its north-facing side. It is wrapped with an external staircase that has seen better decades. Despite the name, it is currently the only granary within the town’s walls. Outside Ubersreik, several smaller granaries can be found in nearby villages, but they are too far away for general use by local bakers. Over the years, a number of ‘New Granaries’ have been constructed in many sites across the town, but all have burned down after unfortunate accidents. Indeed, as ﬂour is extremely ﬂammable and prone to exploding, fire is a constant risk, and many precautions are taken to ensure there is never a problem. Because of this, the Old Granary is heavily guarded, and no naked ﬂames, engineers, or wizards are permitted within ten feet by law.</p><p>The Blessed Guild of Lady’s Vale’s Master Millers owns and maintains the Old Granary. The guildhouse is located in a small adjoining building to the granary’s rear. Most of the guilds’ members live outside Ubersreik’s walls in their farms, so the guildhouse has a dormitory to house visiting millers. Flour is sold from a small kiosk to the fore of the guildhouse, not from the granary itself. Purchasers receive a clay chitty that can be redeemed at the Old Granary in exchange for the purchased amount of ﬂour. The chitty set is changed daily to make it difficult for counterfeits to be used.</p><p>Ruprecht Adelmann, a deeply tanned man with dark hair with tight curls, is the guild’s Ubersreik representative. Also a member of the @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.FIx69aLJxrJczytP]{Merchant's Guild}, Adelmann works to further the aims of both his guilds, ensuring all parties profit to their mutual benefit. He has a relatively plain office in the guildhouse, where he is often found after hours entertaining young men and women he picks up from local taverns and inns. Adelmann’s family, who live in Grausee some twenty miles south of Ubersreik, are completely unaware of his frequent dalliances.</p><section id=\"secret-8lnWrz1DNnXnZ019\" class=\"secret\"><ul><li><p>The troops from @UUID[JournalEntry.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.V6tkgQ9A2skppjyl]{Altdorf} have come with their own supply of ﬂour, which has driven down local prices and initiated a trade war between @UUID[JournalEntry.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.V6tkgQ9A2skppjyl]{Altdorf} and Ubersreik. Should something happen to the Old Granary, it would devastate the local market, opening it up to importers. Marta Kroll, an Altdorfer merchant, is hoping this happens so she can trade with importers.</p></li><li><p>Adelmann’s system of chitties is efficient and visionary. It is also very easy to counterfeit. The party is asked to acquire a chitty and deliver it to a fence, who will meet them in @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.ddQoNatt6T4Fd2ZY]{The Red Moon Inn}. The ‘Fence’ is actually an agent of Captain Pfeffer of the Watch, on the lookout for a ring of counterfeiters. Quick-talking by the PCs might see them hired as her agents. A less spectacular result has them arrested as co-conspirators.</p></li></ul></section>",

The Karstadts also have offices in @UUID[JournalEntry.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.V6tkgQ9A2skppjyl]{Altdorf} and Nuln, all managed by prominent family members, and finance several merchant trains crossing the Grey Lady Pass to Bretonnia and the Dwarf Holds.</p>\n<p>Unknown to most, the Karstadts were formerly nobles of Ubersreik. Decades ago, Baron Victor Karstadt chose to surrender his nobility as a condition of a deal with the von Bruners to secure a significant loan. Contrary to all commentators at the time, it turned out to be a prudent decision. The family fortunes have significantly changed for the better since the von Bruner deal, as evidenced by their growing numbers and luxurious accommodations.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Actor.Je9bENZeEyEaQR9p]{Hellin Karstadt-Stampf} is the current head of the family and a woman so wealthy the Jungfreuds courted her for years, despite her effective lack of nobility. After teasing @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-ua2.ua2-actors.KHU4UeFIP5yokI6u]{Sigismund von Jungfreud} for almost three years, she eventually chose to marry a spectacularly wealthy merchant from Altdorf instead, a decision that caused uproar in Ubersreik at the time. For many years it was a matter of some debate whether she married for love, or for riches, though most suggested it was the latter.</p>\n<p>Perhaps proving this opinion true, Hellin’s husband, Leuthold, rarely leaves the Karstadt-Stampf offices in Altdorf. His primary interest is in banking, so he spends much of his time consolidating that business in the imperial capital. Consequently, he hasn’t been seen in Ubersreik for several years, which is, of course, a juicy piece of gossip for local busybodies, who are quick to conclude the Karstadt-Stampf marriage has broken down. The hearsay  concerning this is only exacerbated by Hellin’s vociferous, and oft-shared, hatred for @UUID[JournalEntry.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.V6tkgQ9A2skppjyl]{Altdorf}, which means she has never travelled to see her husband. Unsurprisingly, most believe she has no love for her husband beyond his business acumen and deep coffers.</p>\n<p>However, Hellin’s love for her many children, strong-willed though they may be, is undeniable. She hosts lavish parties whenever one should return to Ubersreik, and goes out of her way to attend to their every need, no matter how grand. Helping Hellin achieve this, @UUID[Actor.b7SY081CpP0aQndx]{Josef Specht}, the Karstadt-Stampf purser, is never far from her side. An unassuming fellow, Specht is an almost invisible presence, yet is quickly on hand with a quill and ink, or a supply of coins, should he be needed. Of course, the gossipmongers of Ubersreik presume Sprecht offers far more than simple financial advice to his mistress, for all it is widely known he is a happily married man.</p>\n<div style=\"display:flex;justify-content:space-evenly;flex-wrap:wrap\">\n<div style=\"display:flex;flex-direction:column;justify-content:space-evenly;align-items:center\"><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/hellin-karstadt-stampf.webp\" width=\"212\" height=\"250\" />\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">@UUID[Actor.Je9bENZeEyEaQR9p]{Hellin Karstadt-Stampf}</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display:flex;flex-direction:column;justify-content:space-evenly;align-items:center\"><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/josef-specht.webp\" width=\"231\" height=\"244\" />\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">@UUID[Actor.b7SY081CpP0aQndx]{Josef Specht}</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<section id=\"secret-EzvZtPB2pvCh96Vc\" class=\"secret\">\n<h3 class=\"no-toc\">Spoiled Rotten</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Hellin’s son, Alfred, yearns for a title to complement the wealth he will inherit when his mother passes. he is convinced the von Bruners retain his Grandfather’s patents of nobility. he will richly reward anyone who will break into the @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.U5fSG8wDw2ZCLIWG]{Bruner Palace} to retrieve them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Hellin’s daughter, Annika, has no interest in trade, longing instead to pursue a martial career. she will pay the party to train her in secret, hiring them to complete odd jobs around the estate to cover their furtive martial activities. but when Annika gets injured sparring, they will have to think fast.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</section>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img class=\"fit\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/karstadt-estate.webp\" /></div>",

      "Content": "<p>Ubersreik’s sewers are extensive and a source of local pride. Indeed, many a visitor to Ubersreik has had the misfortune of receiving a guided tour when merely feigning polite interest! </p>\n<p>Two distinct networks exist: one to the city’s north, and another to the south. Both networks discharge into the Teufel through wide, steel-grated culverts. The northern sewer-gate is named the Magnusschleuse, and the southern the Sigmarschleuse. Both are checked routinely to ensure no undesirables gain entrance to Ubersreik illicitly (or that those who do have bribed the right people). However, as responsibility for this task lay with the Jungfreuds, neither gate has been officially checked for some time.</p>\n<p>Each network comprises around a dozen major, arterial sewers, through which a four-foot wide effluent channel flows, flanked by equally wide walkways. The ceilings are high to allow for the dispersal of noxious fumes and vapours. Smaller tunnels connect these arterial sewers. These have a lower ceiling and only a single walkway to one side. Vaulted chambers, twenty-feet across, sit at the junctions. Intricate carvings of Dwarf faces line the chambers’ columns, though few consider the splendid sight worth the appalling reek. Most waste reaches the sewers through narrow lead pipes, though larger houses and estates have wider pipes that are more akin to small tunnels. Sewer grates are also found on the streets of the more affluent areas on the south side, such as @UUID[.CI7BOaVBiL3tOBxR]{the Hill}, or the @UUID[.lMkiSBk0fM2nkGZv]{Merchant Quarter}. </p>\n<p>When Greenskins razed the town 200 years ago, the sewers were untouched, and many hid beneath as Orcs and Goblins rampaged above. Later, when Magnus the Pious returned to the Empire and marched to retake Ubersreik, Empire infiltrators, led by Dwarf scouts, entered the town through the sewer grates. Once inside, they crept through the streets and opened the town gates, surprising the occupying Greenskin forces by simultaneously attacking from above and beneath. This story is well known locally, but the invading Altdorfers have no idea just how easily the town walls can be circumvented.</p>\n<h3>What Lurks Beneath</h3>\n<p>Despite the best efforts of the town’s ratcatchers, sewerjacks and Watch, the sewers remain host to a number of undesirable creatures. The southern network, known as the Sigmarsewers after its sewer-gate the Sigmarschleuse, is better maintained, especially of late, given the rat catchers’ regular patrols. Nonetheless, there have been numerous sightings of fast-moving Beastmen, with ratlike visages and high-pitched, chittering voices. Anyone blundering about in the sewers, especially after nightfall, is likely to encounter something they would rather forget. </p>\n<p>The Magnussewers lie underneath the north half of the town. These are less regularly patrolled, and since the Jungfreuds were ejected from Ubersreik, no-one has been clearing them out. In addition to the omnipresent threat of ratmen, other creatures call the sewers home. </p>\n<div style=\"display:flex;justify-content:space-evenly;flex-wrap:wrap\">\n<div style=\"display:flex;flex-direction:column;justify-content:space-evenly;align-items:center\"><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/gutter-runner.webp\" width=\"175\" height=\"227\" />\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">@UUID[Actor.xRNhtsO9EEWqTA8C]{Skaven Gutter Runner}</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display:flex;flex-direction:column;justify-content:space-evenly;align-items:center\"><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/swarm-of-rats.webp\" width=\"182\" height=\"202\" />\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">@UUID[Actor.lDizGNnhMbMdtTRI]{Skaven Giant Rat Swarm}</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display:flex;flex-direction:column;justify-content:space-evenly;align-items:center\"><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/doppelganger.webp\" width=\"191\" height=\"234\" />\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">@UUID[Actor.Ys5UBwxxIVQiEUmH]{Brandt - Doppelganger}</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"journal-image\"><img class=\"fit\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/ubersreik-sewers.webp\" /></div>",
