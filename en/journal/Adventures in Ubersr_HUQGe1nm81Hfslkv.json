      "Content": "<p>Ubersreik awakens to the sounds of soldiers locking down the town. @UUID[Actor.gfSfXHgfqW5QiUxu]{General von Dabernick’s} signet ring has been stolen. As the party comes to terms with the new restrictions, @UUID[Actor.NH9yZnUFgSzMTKjz]{Molrella} is approached by her twin-sister, Halamina (known as Mi-mi). She has recently arrived in Ubersreik, and surprising no one, the ring is in her possession. <em>‘It weren’t my fault! I didn’t mean to steal it! I lifted it from an ’andsome chap last night; cut it from his pouch when fishing for coins’. But she doesn’t want to dump it. ‘What if some wizard finds it like last time, and casts spells that tell everyone that I did the nicking!’ Fortunately, Mi-mi has a plan: ‘Let’s sneak into the general’s rooms and pop the ring under his bed! It’ll look like he dropped it himself. Simple, eh? I just dunno how to get in there. Can you help, Molls? Pleeeeeese! The place is almost empty since the Youngfroods were kicked out. It’ll be easy!’</em></p>\n<h4><strong>Enter Edmund Streissen</strong></h4>\n<p>Unfortunately for Mi-mi, the actual thief, @UUID[Actor.nzjn043to6q9JRQh]{Edmund Streissen}, knows who cut his purse. Worse, Streissen followed her and now plans to kill the pesky Halfling, retrieve the ring, then implicate the PCs while he’s at it. Even worse, Streissen is a Chaos Sorcerer of Slaanesh, the Prince of Pleasure. He intended to use the ring in a ritual to control @UUID[Actor.gfSfXHgfqW5QiUxu]{von Dabernick}, and he is not happy it was stolen.</p>\n<h4><strong>Enter Maglyn ‘Maggie’ Blanck</strong></h4>\n<p>Unfortunately for Streissen, @UUID[Actor.xgNRRPBnkRvMoAOp]{Maglyn ‘Maggie’ Blanck} is hot on his heels. A wizard from the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-altdorf.altdorf-journals.083VuqZrmQvGvFFv]{Grey College} of Magic, Maggie poses as a servant in @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.Nhd3vUOVqhDhtRty]{Black Rock Castle}. She knows Streissen stole the ring, and presumes the PCs, who now have the ring, are also Chaos Cultists. Luckily, Maggie is reasonable, and may be convinced of the party’s good intentions if an opportunity arises.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image\" style=\"display:flex;justify-content:space-evenly;flex-wrap:wrap\">\n<div style=\"display:flex;flex-direction:column;justify-content:space-evenly;align-items:center\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/edmund-streissen.webp\" width=\"174\" height=\"242\" />\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">@UUID[Actor.nzjn043to6q9JRQh]{Edmund Streissen}</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display:flex;flex-direction:column;justify-content:space-evenly;align-items:center\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/maglyn-blanck.webp\" width=\"226\" height=\"236\" />\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">@UUID[Actor.xgNRRPBnkRvMoAOp]{Maglyn ‘Maggie’ Blanck}</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3><strong>In Black Rock</strong></h3>\n<p>As Striessen stalks the PCs, ‘Servant’ Maggie ‘accidentally’ bumps into them as they creep through the corridors of @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.Nhd3vUOVqhDhtRty]{Black Rock Castle}. She’s keen to hear their excuses for being in the place. She has no wish to stop them, preferring to track them down later to find their accomplices. Streissen is her target.</p>\n<p>Eventually, @UUID[Actor.gfSfXHgfqW5QiUxu]{von Dabernick’s} chamber is found. Streissen attacks the party upon entry. In turn, Maggie attacks Streissen. Unfortunately for all concerned, if Streissen is wounded, a @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.bestiary.8gG2Wim6wAlJWRax]{Daemonette} is accidentally summoned when blood splashes on his nose ring (prematurely activating a ritual prepared for a party that evening). The Daemonette stretches, giggles, then slashes out with horrendous ferocity. Assuming Streissen hasn’t retrieved the ring by this point, he realises it has all gone a bit wrong and attempts escape. Then the alarm is raised across @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.Nhd3vUOVqhDhtRty]{Black Rock Castle}.</p>\n<p>Once the Daemon is dispatched, if the PCs are clearly not in league with Streissen, Maggie will help them escape, demanding a favour in return. If the Characters appear to be allies of Streissen, Maggie will abandon them as Altdorf-liveried halberdiers fill the corridors.</p>\n<h3><strong>Aftermath</strong></h3>\n<p>If it all turns out well, Mi-mi will thank her sister profusely. ‘<em>I’ll be the helping you, next time!</em>’ Of course, a few months later: ‘<em>Molls! I accidentally stole a magical tiara from a Cathayan Sorcerer! And her wife is livid! But I can’t get it off! And it’s caused a diplomatic incident wiv the Emperor himself! Can you help, Molls? Pleeeeese!’</em></p>\n<div class=\"journal-image\"><img class=\"fit\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/two-wrongs.webp\" /></div>",

      "Content": "<p>Baron Aloysis Arschloch, @UUID[Actor.VdDotfA5zyWYdtwc]{Ferdinand’s} childhood friend, asks for help. ‘<em>The townsfolk of Flechtben claim some ghost or another is protecting them. So, your area, old chap, not mine.</em>’ The Arschloch family once ruled Flechtben town. But the peasants have self-ruled for the last 300 years. They celebrate a local hero named ‘Blaue Augen’, who supposedly fought the tyrannical Baron Arschloch of their day and won the small town’s freedom. Local legend claims @UUID[Actor.octRyafIOk1ZNiLL]{Blaue Augen} will return should the folk of Flechtben ever need him, and he is generally celebrated as a great hero. Arschloch doesn’t believe a word of it. He will pay Ferdinand and his party a hefty @Credit[4gc EACH]{4 Gold Crowns} each to fix the supposed ghost problem.</p><p>The troubles started when Mayor Helmut Holt decided to host a festival celebrating Flechtben’s 300th year as a free town. Given this involved burning a huge effigy of Arschloch’s ancestor, the baron took this as an insult to his family name. So, Arschloch threatened to imprison any revellers travelling through his town of Leche to reach Flechtben. Not long after, the hauntings began. Strange lights, moving objects, cold spots, and worse slowly spread across Leche. Nothing serious, but Arschloch doesn’t like it. And to make matters worse, reports of twin, blue fires in the woods around Flechtben are also coming in. Arschloch wants the Characters to discover the truth behind these so-called ‘haunting’.</p><h3><strong>Hauntings?</strong></h3><p>By the time the Characters arrive in Leche, the hauntings have already ended, leaving them nothing but a cold trail. In Flechtben, it’s another matter. There, the townsfolk are abuzz with stories of @UUID[Actor.octRyafIOk1ZNiLL]{Blaue Augen}. They tell embellished tales of his deeds saving their town from the evils of the Arschlochs, often framing Blue Eyes as Ranald Returned or even Sigmar Reborn! Many townsfolk believe the spirit of Blaue Augen lives within an abandoned tower in @UUID[JournalEntry.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.UqeZNqbpV8uocCUN]{The Reikwald} Forest to the north, where they leave offerings of thanks to their mighty hero.</p><p>If investigated, the tower is a ruin. However, there is evidence of recent habitation and activity: a burned-out fire, a relatively fresh latrine pit, some odd scorch markings, and an abandoned leather satchel full of blue powder. There is also a lot of blood. But no body.</p><p>Following the blood trails leads to a heavily wounded, women, panicking and in pain. When she calms, she introduces herself as Gertrude Farlanger, an engineer. Martich Wolochin, the burgomeister of Flechtben, employed Farlanger and her husband, Davrich, to fake hauntings in Leche and post blue lights in the forest around his town. Presumably, this was all to support the festival and punish the Arschlochs. Farlanger was camped by the tower, believing it a safe spot in the woods. That morning, her husband was investigating the tower ruins, and used some of her explosives to open a chamber he found. Then the slab cracked, a screaming howl deafened her as a spirit twisted into the air and plunged into Davrich’s face. He then turned to his wife, his eyes and mouth dripping blue fire, and attacked.</p><p>If the secret chamber is investigated, the Characters will find walls covered in bright frescos untouched by time. They depict a great hero in Arschloch heraldry defeating a mighty Wraith with burning eyes. According to one wall painted in delicate gold, Flechten town was granted a charter to self-govern as a reward for their support in capturing and sealing the blue-eyed Wraith beneath the tower, and in return for swearing to protect the unholy site from future harm.</p><h3><strong>Back In Flechtben</strong></h3><p>When the Characters return to Flechtben, @UUID[Actor.octRyafIOk1ZNiLL]{Blaue Augen} is on a murderous rampage. It has already killed scores of townsfolk, and the rest are on the run, utterly incapable of harming the undead monster. Any remnants of Davrich’s body are burned away by the blue fire, leaving a black-robed, skeletal horror.</p><p>As it can only be harmed by magic, this is a tough fight, and @UUID[Actor.VdDotfA5zyWYdtwc]{Ferdinand} will be key to it. Assuming the Characters survive, Arschloch is good to his word and gladly pays. Further, when he finds out the source of the town’s charter as a free town, he invades Flechtben, quickly securing it as part of his fiefdom. ‘<em>Well, they didn’t protect that tower, did they, old chap? I’m only doing what is right and proper.’ </em></p><p>However, the new Baron of Flechtben is anything but right and proper, and proceeds to punish what remains of the townsfolk for their years of rebellion and besmirchment of his good family name.</p><div class=\"journal-image\"><img class=\"fit\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/blue-eyes.webp\" /></div>",

      "Content": "<p>The village of Grauner is no longer protected by State Soldiers because of the recent turmoil. So, Gavrich Bloch, the son of the village elder, and old army friend of @UUID[Actor.Z5D8INeGdPo4esse]{Salundra’s}, reaches out for help. Gavrich wants to train a local militia, but was never a good officer, so he asks Salundra to stand in. ‘<em>C’mon Sal, it’ll be like the old days!</em>’  The folk of Grauner would normally petition their lord, Baron Ruprecht Graufelsen — and Salundra’s cousin — for such training, however he refuses to provide assistance.</p><p>Gavrich knows there is no love lost between Salundra and her cousin Ruprecht, so he hopes she and her friends will help. Gavrich can’t pay, but lodgings are provided, and as much beer as everyone can drink from the local tavern, The Bog King’s Arms.</p><h3><strong>At Grauner</strong></h3><p>Upon arrival, the Characters meet Sebastian Bloch, the village elder and Gavrich’s father; @UUID[Actor.pqXdP14EWc9KcAhU]{Berthilda Hebamme}, a widower who leads the Woman’s Council; and Parzival Reisefuhrer, a busybody Bailiff. Gavrich suggests Reisefuhrer should be distracted to keep him ignorant of the preparations, as he may kill the baron. </p><p>Elder Bloch and Hebamme suggest the Characters make an excuse for their presence, perhaps claiming they’re hunting Beastmen for employers back in Ubersreik. If this suggestion is taken, Reisefuhrer immediately shows interest in scouting with the Characters. ‘<em>Finally, true soldiers! We shall see what’s what!</em>’ </p><p>In truth, Reisefuhrer is looking to quiz the Characters’ as he’s actively looking for suspicious activity. Baron Ruprecht’s refuses to allow a local militia due to reports of potential Dark Cult activity among the villagers. The baron is not sure if the villagers are corrupt, so he refuses to arm them, but he also doesn’t want to lose the taxes, so he has not ordered a purge. Instead, he sent Reisefuhrer to be his eyes and ears. Reisefuhrer will report back whatever he learns of the Characters to his master that evening.</p><h3><strong>The Attack</strong></h3><p>The next evening, a small herd of @UUID[Actor.K57y8T7OKCJl2uEX]{Beastmen} attacks Grauner.</p><p>The villagers let the PCs deal with this. The @UUID[Actor.K57y8T7OKCJl2uEX]{Beastmen} will retreat as soon as the battle turns against them. Any Character who performs a <strong>Simple Lore (Reikland)</strong> or <strong>Intuition </strong>Test will know this is uncharacteristic behaviour; Beastmen normally don’t retreat so quickly. Still, the folk of Grauner celebrate the victory, throwing a feast in their honour. In truth, the secret Cultist orchestrated the attack, using it to test the Characters’ mettle.</p><h3><strong>Accusations</strong></h3><p>Next morning, an agent of the baron — Witch Hunter Hedwig Tiermann — arrives with 6 soldiers. Tiermann claims the Characters are heretics, and provides Baron Ruprecht’s testimony that @UUID[Actor.Z5D8INeGdPo4esse]{Salundra} is a rebellious cur who chooses the soldier’s life over the duty of being a noble scion! She must reveal herself now! Fortunately, @UUID[Actor.pqXdP14EWc9KcAhU]{Hebamme} offers to smuggle the party from Grauner as Gavrich and Elder Bloch delay the Witch Hunter.</p><h3><strong>The Blood Flows</strong></h3><p>Unfortunately, @UUID[Actor.pqXdP14EWc9KcAhU]{Hebamme} is also the cultist. She lost her husband, Ortlouf, to Beastmen five years ago in an ill-advised attack ordered by Baron Ruprecht. When Hebamme learned this, she flew into a rage and stormed into the woods, her wrath incredible. She slew many Beastmen before, surprising her, those remaining bowed to her in supplication, sensing the Blood God within her. Hebamme then realised who her real enemy was, and now lives for one thing only: to kill Baron Ruprecht and all his kin. Including @UUID[Actor.Z5D8INeGdPo4esse]{Salundra}. Hebamme leads the party to a wood where 8 @UUID[Actor.K57y8T7OKCJl2uEX]{Beastmen} hide, and screams in apparent fear as they ambush. When its least expected, she then picks up a warstave hidden behind a tree and bellows, ‘Blood for the Blood God!’ before joining the fray against the party.</p><p>No one believes Hebamme’s betrayal unless the party brings proof; proof that is heretical to carry. If wise, the Characters retreat to Ubersreik. Of course, Tiermann will follow, almost certainly with accusations of defenceless Frau Hebamme murder…</p><div class=\"journal-image\"><img class=\"fit\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/memories-of-blood.webp\" /></div>",

He is often accused of bending the truth to attract greater attention to his dwindling importance in the town. However, this priest who has cried wolf before is not exaggerating this time. </p><p>@UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.U2JMbu5g9oyCT4eH]{The Tin Spur} has two new attractions, and they are drawing massive crowds: an enormous snow-white wolfhound named Eisfange, and a tall blond Middenlander with piercing blue eyes named @UUID[Actor.c6aJd9hIoNxzAqLl]{Reikhardt Gestaltenstark}. Neither has lost a match — either forcing their opponents to yield or brutally tearing out their throats. The crowd is baying for the two to fight in what must surely be the spectacle of the decade. But this will never happen. Gestaltenstark and Eisfange are one and the same. Reikhardt Gestaltenstark is a Child of Ulric — a creature gifted (or cursed) with the ability to shapeshift between that of a wolf and a man. Thus far, Gestaltenstark’s true identity hasn’t been discovered by anyone, though @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.H4lW8llwfJ24iyj3]{Father Kretschmer} has his suspicions.</p><p>@UUID[Actor.c6aJd9hIoNxzAqLl]{Gestaltenstark} isn’t interested in acclaim — though he is certainly receiving his fair share. Instead, Gestaltenstark dreams of an Empire united once more in the veneration of Ulric over Sigmar. He is recruiting both hounds and pit fighters to his cause — offering them life and purpose if they yield to him — in an effort to weaken the Cult of Sigmar in Ubersreik and maybe the Empire at large!</p><p>Whilst @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.H4lW8llwfJ24iyj3]{Denfather Kretschmer} would like nothing more than to be relevant again, he’s not a madman, and sees the instability that @UUID[Actor.c6aJd9hIoNxzAqLl]{Gestaltenstark} would bring as more of an affront to Ulric than a boon. The Denfather requests the Characters to infiltrate the Tin Spur via any means necessary. He urges them to then convince Wilhelm Shütteln, the proprietor, to take them on as pit fighters or players, sneak in the back during one of the shows, or perhaps join the entourage of one of the many young rakes who frequent the venue and are given the privilege of going back stage. Once on the inside, they need to prove Gestaltenstark’s identity, and drive him off — even going so far as to kill him if necessary. However, the Father is insistent they do so without revealing to Ubersreik the nature of Gestaltenstark’s curse, for it will cast a long shadow over the Cult of Ulric in the region.</p><div class=\"journal-image\"><img class=\"fit\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/reikhardt-gestaltenstark.webp\" /></div><p>@UUID[Actor.c6aJd9hIoNxzAqLl]{Gestaltenstark} isn’t an easy man to reach. He lives deep within the pit fighters’ quarters beneath the Tin Spur. He is always surrounded by pit fighters (use @UUID[Actor.08otYmy2EeLkq4aM]{Leif Vilsson}’s statistics to represent them) who have sworn themselves to protect Gestaltenstark to their death. Worse, a pack of loyal hounds (@UUID[Actor.aZsA9tS9nYWiC8Ft]{Fighting Dogs} from Ubersreik seem to follow his commands with an eerie level of attention and accuracy, and rarely leave his side.  If the Characters can overcome these obstacles and somehow deal with the Child of Ulric, @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.H4lW8llwfJ24iyj3]{Father Kretschmer} will reward them each with @Credit[2gc SPLIT]{2 GC}. If Gestaltenstark’s curse remains a secret to Ubersreik, the Father is overjoyed, and will offer his services as a teacher for rare Skills and Talents or even initiate an interested Character into the Cult of Ulric.</p>",

Whilst the town of Ubersreik itself is Greenskin-free, the @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.yJlaZDmJgb5rIkHM]{Magnussewer tunnels} are infested.</p>\n<p>During the Great War Against Chaos over 200 years ago, Ubersreik fell to the Greenskins.

So, for two centuries they have hidden, growing in strength slowly but surely, eventually blooming into a small tribe of Goblins.</p>\n<p>The Gong-Tongue Tribe has always been small — preyed upon by the many horrors hidden in Ubersreik’s sewers — so they’ve never posed much of a threat.

He now knows of the following incoming threats: an angry Slayer, a shadowy assassin, a Border Prince’s agents, and a ghostly <em>something</em> haunting his inn.</p><h3><strong>Lohner's Enemies</strong></h3><div style=\"display:flex;justify-content:space-evenly;flex-wrap:wrap\"><div style=\"display:flex;flex-direction:column;justify-content:space-evenly;align-items:center\"><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/shrinq-shaderipper.webp\" width=\"183\" height=\"183\" /><p style=\"text-align:center\">@UUID[Actor.vDyDfvkHTQ7JX8if]{Shrinq Shaderipper}</p></div><div style=\"display:flex;flex-direction:column;justify-content:space-evenly;align-items:center\"><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/carmellos-crew.webp\" width=\"177\" height=\"177\" /><p style=\"text-align:center\">@UUID[Actor.jeCgW4SNgCu7d9dR]{Carmello's Crew}</p></div><div style=\"display:flex;flex-direction:column;justify-content:space-evenly;align-items:center\"><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/tah-ra-mentuhr.webp\" width=\"194\" height=\"189\" /><p style=\"text-align:center\">@UUID[Actor.Dfb1YdBY1Vgs2Y79]{Tah-Ra Mentuhr}</p></div><div style=\"display:flex;flex-direction:column;justify-content:space-evenly;align-items:center\"><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/thikad-urgolsson.webp\" width=\"164\" height=\"164\" /><p style=\"text-align:center\">@UUID[Actor.rpIcUXefVyxO8aML]{Thikad Urgolsson}</p></div></div><h3><strong>Lohner's Plan</strong></h3><p>@UUID[Actor.k7qn4SFIygpbL5GS]{Lohner} has a plan to escape this mess. He will announce loudly his inn’s closure for business on the night of his birthday, so he can have a quiet evening of prayer to @UUID[JournalEntry.NcH9OhleJFfaUdon.JournalEntryPage.TjfeXu3fimHJ5I9Q]{Shallya, Goddess of Mercy}, to thank her for his long life. This, he hopes, will lure his foes to attack. He will then blow up the inn, killing as many of his enemies as possible, then fake his death. But doing this will require assistance, so Lohner will pay handsomely for help: @Pay[10gc EACH]{10 Gold Crowns} per Character!</p><p>If they agree to help, @UUID[Actor.k7qn4SFIygpbL5GS]{Lohner} suggests the Characters plan the ambush thoroughly, and shows a keen tactical mind when discussing this. He suggests the following, but reminds the Characters preparation is in their hands as he can’t directly help for fear of arousing suspicion:</p><ul><li><p>Grodni Surehammer of @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.wht9BofyQGmtinWN]{The Axe and Hammer} will supply explosives to blow up the @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.ddQoNatt6T4Fd2ZY]{Red Moon}, if the Characters give their word to assist the Dwarf in future. Alternately, @UUID[Actor.jeCgW4SNgCu7d9dR]{Carmello's Crew} frequents this shop, and will notice the purchase.</p></li><li><p>@UUID[Actor.N3hGHrY2P51BNTYO]{Cordelia Wesselingh} may help deal with the Wraith. She can modify any explosives to affect it (adding the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.traits.mDgEMOoJpi8DkRYb]{Magical} Trait to the bombs). Lohner won’t involve the @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.SI1GHUlvYSCofVcB]{town’s wizard} as this may bring uncomfortable questions. Lohner doesn’t know Wesselingh is a spy for the wizard.</p></li><li><p>Lohner requires a pathway out of the city after his inn goes up in flames, so suggests talking to Karsten Rugger of the @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.AIMlOScGrg8pmSdl]{Boatmen’s Guild}. Lohner knows Rugger is a smuggler, and suggests working for him to secure co-operation.</p></li><li><p>An experimental ‘time-keeper candle’ developed for Prochnow of the @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.b7O2qxgkBbDE6ip5]{Guild of Boatbuilders and Chandlers} could act as a fuse. Prochnow will sell a time-keeper for @Pay[5ss]{5 shillings}.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>The Attack</strong></h3><p>Let the Characters make any preparations they feel are necessary. Unless there is a better plan, Lohner will dress a makeshift decoy and place it in a taproom chair, and will then help the Characters as required. Unless otherwise alerted, Lohner’s enemies will assault the @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.ddQoNatt6T4Fd2ZY]{Red Moon} using the following timeline:</p><p><strong>9pm</strong>: @UUID[Actor.vDyDfvkHTQ7JX8if]{Shaderipper} sneaks in via the chimney, then hides in Lohner’s wardrobe. Not long after, @UUID[Actor.Dfb1YdBY1Vgs2Y79]{Tah-Ra Mentuhr} begins to manifest in the taproom.</p><p><strong>9:15</strong>: @UUID[Actor.rpIcUXefVyxO8aML]{Urgolsson} arrives and drunkenly shouts outside for Lohner to meet his fate. By this point, Tah-Ra Mentuhr can be seen by characters with the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.talents.OEjUvJKi0xmBwbS2]{Second Sight} Talent and can be harmed by Magical attacks.</p><p><strong>9.30</strong>: @UUID[Actor.jeCgW4SNgCu7d9dR]{Carmello's Crew} arrives, and breaks in through a rear upstairs window. Urgolsson then hacks through the front door, ready to confront Lohner. Hearing this commotion, Shaderipper sneaks down to observe, only to encounter Carmello’s Crew on the stairs. At this point, @UUID[Actor.Dfb1YdBY1Vgs2Y79]{Tah-Ra Mentuhr} fully manifests, causes @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.traits.pTorrE0l3VybAbtn]{Fear} on all nearby mortals, and is ready to possess Lohner.</p><p>Once lit, the fuse burns for [[/gmr 1d10+4]] Rounds. As an Action, an <strong>Average (+20) Simple Perception</strong> Test can determine this time. If Prochnow’s time-keeper candle is used, the Character lighting it can choose a fuse time of 4 to 12 Rounds. When the explosion occurs, all within the inn suffer [[/gmr 1d10+15]] Damage and 5 @Condition[Ablaze] Conditions. Any enemies surviving the explosion will flee, and, if they escape, will remain at large.</p><div class=\"journal-image\"><img class=\"fit\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/saif-al-janub.webp\" /></div><h3><strong>The Aftermath</strong></h3><p>When Lohner and the party have found their way to safety — perhaps in the Boatmen’s Guild — Lohner will proclaim he has never felt more alive since he was a Grudgebringer, and that faking his death is just not for him. Instead, he will rebuild the @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.ddQoNatt6T4Fd2ZY]{Red Moon Inn}, and ensure good folk like the Characters are always served. He will then pay the Characters for their help, and will also offer a bonus of an exquisite Arabyan  scimitar, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-starter-set.items.rIBB37yMATXRnFbp]{Saif al-Janub}, if all his enemies were killed.</p><div class=\"journal-image\"><img class=\"fit\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/franz-lohner.webp\" /></div>",

Prisoners were taken, and sickness followed, leaving folk anxious and unwell. There are 7 farms to investigate: 3 near Geissbach, 2 by Wurfel, and 2 by Buchendorf. At the farms of Buchendorf, it seems doubtful the culprits are Beastmen: the arrows may be primitive, made of wood and flint, but they are well-crafted. At Wurfel, it seems the raids lack the brutality associated with Beastmen, with many corpses untouched. However, before Geissbach can be investigated, an unexpected visitor approaches the PCs at The Halfway House coaching inn.</p>\n<h3><strong>First Star I See Tonight</strong></h3>\n<p>Illyrius Starsight — the 7-foot tall Envoy of House Emberfell of Caledor — arrives to escort Amris home. Illyrius, a powerful Asur Mage, owes Amris’s father, so has linked to Amris magically in order to track him. However, Illyrius is fair, and recognises @UUID[Actor.njohRTHP8jMyApA9]{Amris} has commitments, so allows one week to resolve his business.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image float-right flip\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/unions-reunions.webp\" width=\"320\" height=\"267\" /></div>\n<h3><strong>Elf Help</strong></h3>\n<p>When investigating near the Grunewald Forest, a musical voice calls to @UUID[Actor.njohRTHP8jMyApA9]{Amris}. A pale Wood Elf then steps from the trees. She claims to be Ulliamar Skytear, a spellsinger. She felt Amris’s aura, and came to warn him. Her camp was attacked by Beastmen, and one of her kinband was taken. Ulliamer has never met an Asur before, so offers to take Amris and his friends to meet her Kindred. As she walks, Ulliamar queries the powerful magical link she senses in Amris. Whatever explanations are offered, Ulliamar offers to sever it, claiming such shackles are an abomination. In effect, Amris can escape Illyrius, and the ritual required is simple.</p>\n<h3><strong>The Ritual</strong></h3>\n<p>The PCs are fed curiously spiced meats as the ritual is prepared. Ulliamar explains that @UUID[Actor.njohRTHP8jMyApA9]{Amris} needs to enact a ceremonial — and non-binding — marriage, forming a new bond to break the one Illyrius magically imposed. If Amris agrees, he is taken to a dewy clearing, dressed in flowing green-brown robes, and wrapped in plants in various states of growth, fecundity, and decay. The other PCs are then asked to leave, for the rite is sacred to the Elves.</p>\n<h3><strong>Investigating The Camp</strong></h3>\n<p>All the Wood Elves attend the ritual, so the other PCs can freely search the camp. There they find sleek, flint arrows, odd potions of death and decay, and a clearing filled with Human bones…</p>\n<h3><strong>The Hallowed</strong></h3>\n<p>Regrettably for @UUID[Actor.njohRTHP8jMyApA9]{Amris}, the Wood Elves are servants of Nurgle, the Chaos God of Disease. The ritual re-enacts the marriage of Nurgle (as Amris) to his stolen bride, the Elven Goddess Isha (as Ulliamar). When the ritual ends. Amris gains [[/r 1d10]] Corruption points and an @Condition[Unconscious] Condition.

When you have had your fill, come to me by the Tree of Sores and Sorrows</em>.’  Then Ulliamar and her Kindred melt away into the trees.</p>\n<p>The other Characters then burst onto the scene. Assuming the foul thing is defeated, it will cry pus-laden tears as it dies. Not long after, Illyrius will arrive, having sensed the foul disturbance. He will be impressed that Amris is capable of slaying a Daemon. Illyrius claims this shows, though young, that perhaps Amris is worthy of making his own decisions since they seem wise. And with that, he leaves.</p>",

      "Content": "<p>Johann Hoffmann — a famous Stevedore who was responsible for the Ubersreik Trade Guild Treaties of 2506 before falling from grace — has disappeared. Hoffmann was last seen alightling a black coach at the @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.alatSQnvNobt63Gr]{Bridge House Inn}. </p><p>Now conspiracy theories are moving through Ubersreik like the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.diseases.txeLd7R13qxSvmsr]{Galloping Trots}! He was always a controversial figure who was on everyone’s lips, and his disappearance has only increased his fame. Hoffmann was loved for his life-long involvement with the trade guilds. </p><p>However, his success made him a target of the Lowhaven Clan — a criminal family of Halflings with their fingers in every pie in Reikland, even the ones trampled to smithereens during the riot. They extorted Hoffman to perform deeds supporting their goals. Three years ago this was uncovered, and Hoffman was imprisoned after his offices were raided and documents were found linking Hoffmann and the Lowhavens to an anti-establishment, ‘Death to Karl-Franz’ political faction known as <em>The Glorious Revolution of the People</em> (GRP).</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-ua2.ua2-actors.KHU4UeFIP5yokI6u]{Graf Sigismund von Jungfreud} eventually pardoned Hoffmann, due to local sympathies for Hoffmann. However, since the Jungfreuds’ ousting, Altdorf soldiers have targeted Hoffmann. They feared his political skills, gang contacts, and overall connection to trade guilds would make him a powerful figure in Ubersreik’s (as they saw it) inevitable bid for Freiburg status. Indeed, Wilhelm ‘Big Willi’ Docker, Hoffmann’s replacement in the @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.pIrh6ASaL0C4Ufxq]{Dockers’ Guild} (who was the one to tip off the Watch to get Hoffmann arrested in the first place), has been using his ‘disappearance’ as political leverage. </p><p>Now, General @UUID[Actor.gfSfXHgfqW5QiUxu]{Jendrik von Dabernick} wants some freelancers to investigate the Hoffmann’s disappearance and hopefully uncover the truth behind it. The Altdorfers can’t be seen to be directly involved, for fear of the investigations being labelled a cover up — so the Characters are on their own. In fact, most of the Altdorfers won’t even know an investigation is ongoing, and will refuse to cooperate with anyone sticking their noses into the Emperor’s business…</p><h3><strong>Prime Suspects</strong></h3><p><strong>Wilhelmina Büffa</strong>. Hoffmann’s personal lawyer and childhood friend. It was Büffa who first introduced Hoffmann to the Lowhavens, though she quickly grew to regret that connection. Büffa and the Lowhavens quarrelled, so they blackmailed her, threatening to expose her criminal connections. Those connections eventually saw her removed from her old partnership, @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.uOuZXEv6msA3K8k7]{Spirren-Hirsch and Gärtner}. </p><p>Despite being close to Hoffmann, Büffa has plenty of reason to be rid of him — he had more dirt on her than even the Lowhavens. Indeed, she was the one to plant The Griffon’s Tail in Hoffmann’s office in order to implicate the Lowhavens with the GRP…</p><p><strong>Wilhelm ‘Big Willi’ Docker</strong>. Hoffmann’s long-time rival and replacement in the @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.pIrh6ASaL0C4Ufxq]{Dockers’ Guild}. Big Willi orchestrated the raid that had Hoffmann imprisoned originally, and is now exploiting Hoffmann’s disappearance for political gain, claiming to have been a lifelong friend. In fact, he was also responsible for campaigning to have Hoffmann released from prison! Big Willi’s hatred for the Lowhaven Clan is legendary. He has been known on many occasions to loudly boast that he’ll be the one to bring them all down, no matter what it takes.</p><p><strong>General von Dabernick</strong>. Leader of the Altdorfers who have seized @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.Nhd3vUOVqhDhtRty]{Black Rock Castle}, and who currently occupy Ubersreik. @UUID[Actor.gfSfXHgfqW5QiUxu]{Von Dabernick’s} position in Ubersreik was threatened by Hoffmann’s political sway. The general, though no politician, is smart enough to see how such a disappearance looks bad for him. He is currently engaged in a backroom war with Wilhelm ‘Big Willi’ Docker, who he thought was an ally (and who he helped seize leadership among the @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.pIrh6ASaL0C4Ufxq]{Dockers’ Guild}).</p><p><strong>Mercy Lowhaven</strong>. Leader of the @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.cQvTuhJqYQxXRqbC]{Lowhaven Clan}, and Halfling Crime Boss. Mercy wanted Hoffmann dead, and doesn’t hide that fact, because she wants to destroy any rumour that the Lowhavens are involved with the GRP. In truth, she doesn’t know how copies of The Griffon’s Tail made their way into Hoffmann’s offices. However, she talks about Hoffmann as if he’s on the run and she still wants to kill him (even offering the PCs money to kill him should they uncover his hiding place)!</p><p><strong>Anton Grimski</strong>. An agitator who plies his trade around the @UUID[JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.3pf3VHHG0bVR2qxS]{Sprichstumpf}, who rails against the influence of the merchant class and their corruption. He is actually in the employ of @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-ua2.ua2-actors.KHU4UeFIP5yokI6u]{Sigismund von Jungfreud}, and is attempting to prevent the Burgomeister and the trade guilds of Ubersreik from maintaining order and forming a Freiburg. Grimski has had significant run-ins with Hoffmann over the years, and on several occasions the two have gotten into fist fights with death threats following. Grimski would be more than willing to kill Hoffmann, especially if Jungfreud told him to.</p><h3><strong>Whodunnit</strong></h3><p>So, who’s guilty? And where is Hoffman? That’s up to you to decide. Did @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-ua2.ua2-actors.KHU4UeFIP5yokI6u]{Graf Sigismund} take one last stab at this long-time thorn in his side? Did the @UUID[Actor.gfSfXHgfqW5QiUxu]{General} bump him off to stop his political aspirations, and then used the investigation as a smoke screen? Is Big Willi trying to have his cake and eat it too? Or have Hoffmann’s old mob contacts finally come to collect? Hoffmann appears to have had far more enemies than any realised…</p><div class=\"journal-image\"><img class=\"fit\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/johann.webp\" /></div>",

      "Content": "<p>When perusing a market stall, a silver bracelet catches @UUID[Actor.qbWReZE7UL1p6JXG]{Gunnar’s} eye. It’s identical to one he made long ago. Upon closer inspection, the bracelet isn’t Gunnar’s work, but is a near perfect copy of one he made for his daughter before she, and the rest of his family, died in a fire — the event that spurred Gunnar to swear the Slayer Oath. If asked, the merchant will explain that he purchased the piece — and several similar items, now sold — from a pedlar named Alaricha Brederman in the Blitzhelsen Hills. The pedlar claimed they were Dwarf wrought, purchased from a local artisan.</p>\n<h3><strong>On The Trail</strong></h3>\n<p>With appropriate Gossip, Charm, or Leadership Tests, the party eventually finds Brederman in the Blitfelsen Hills on the road to Graustadt. Somewhat panicked at the unexpected Slayer intrusion, she admits the goods were counterfeit, not Dwarf-forged, and not her work. She claims Gudrun Rogge, a Human smith, discovered a lost Dwarf outpost and uses it to forge objects of exquisite quality. @UUID[Actor.qbWReZE7UL1p6JXG]{Gunnar} once knew Rogge. She was an accomplished Human smith, skilled enough to be invited to @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-archives1.archives1-journals.li0hUcXJfRWyiaBB]{Karak Azgaraz} to train. There, she developed an intense rivalry with Gunnar. She was later forced to leave after she threatened his forge and home, and Gunnar complained. Gunnar always suspected Rogge may have been responsible for his home burning down, but had no proof.</p>\n<h3><strong>Migdhal Agril</strong></h3>\n<p>Bredermann takes the PCs to the old Dwarf outpost — Migdhal Agril — but refuses to enter. Last time Bredermann visited, Rogge threatened to ‘<em>awaken the ancient wonders of the Dawi</em>’ to tear her limb from limb! Should the Characters proceed, Gudrun uses a telescope to watch them wend through the long ravine leading to her forge. A glint of light reflecting against its lens is seen by a Character passing a <strong>Hard (−20) Simple Perception</strong> Test. When she spots her old rival Gunnar, fierce hatred fills her heart once more. If not for @UUID[Actor.qbWReZE7UL1p6JXG]{Gunnar}, she would still be studying in @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-archives1.archives1-journals.li0hUcXJfRWyiaBB]{Karak Azgaraz}.</p>\n<h3><strong>Taunts In the Dark</strong></h3>\n<p>Gudrun Rogge isn’t stupid. Confronting a whole party is unwise. Instead, she clears and prepares her forge as the PCs enter the crumbling complex. She then uses secret tunnels to taunt the party from behind walls. She admits to killing @UUID[Actor.qbWReZE7UL1p6JXG]{Gunnar’s} family, and claims she regrets killing them instead of him. She denounces the ‘<em>foolish Dawi</em>’ for expelling her. She boasts of the ‘<em>improvements</em>’ she’s made to Dwarf techniques, disrespecting Dwarf tradition. She has just one goal: lead the PCs to her forge. This time, Gunnar will die.</p>\n<h4>The Guardian</h4>\n<p>At the rear of Gudrun’s forge squats a massive silver and iron construct detailed with gold, runic script. It’s covered in angular plates, and topped by a bearded, fearsome face, and has newer, dirty pipes attached to its back. This experimental creation is ancient, pitted, and worn, dating from the Goblin Wars thousands of years ago. Gudrun has been working on it for years.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/runic-guardian.webp\" width=\"302\" height=\"294\" /></div>\n<p>When the PCs arrive, the @UUID[Actor.SgK4YI7emNao6k0J]{Guardian} spurts to life. Steam and smoke gouts as it lumbers, ancient limbs crushing any foolish enough to stray too close. If the party consider retreating, Gudrun closes the gates to her forge, trapping the PCs. She then settles in to watch, spitting hatred at the Slayer. Should the Guardian be destroyed, Gudrun will flee, swearing revenge will be hers as she runs.Searching the forge reveals @UUID[Actor.qbWReZE7UL1p6JXG]{Gunnar’s} old tools, the bracelet he made for his daughter, and Gunnar’s sketches for the diadem he was going to craft for his now dead wife. </p>\n<p>Should @UUID[Actor.qbWReZE7UL1p6JXG]{Gunnar} wish to enter the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.wczCPcuHT4VQDLpL.JournalEntryPage.GWrZq3xoRSsDnQe0]{Artisan} Career, he can do so for free if he works from Migdhal Agril.

      "Content": "<p>Hugeldal is the seat of the indomitable Baron Matthais von Jungfreud. Unfortunately, the fall of House Jungfreud in nearby Ubersreik has significantly impacted the town’s fortunes — trade links were severed, tensions rose, and local troops are constantly marching. So, the sudden and unexpected rise in witch signs around Hugeldal, and the panic it engenders, are deeply unwelcome. Yves Plonta, a nervous attendant to Baron Matthais approaches the party to investigate the source of the recent spate of miscarriages, mutant births, disembowelled livestock, and worse that plagues the town. The @Credit[20gc SPLIT]{20 Gold Crown} reward for making it all go away demonstrates just how inflammatory the problem is.</p><h3><strong>Old Memories</strong></h3><p>But this isn’t the first time @UUID[Actor.2UdufyQ0BauhQz5T]{Else} has followed the winding Hugeldal road into @UUID[JournalEntry.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.w0YfGxsBuLoODCgc]{The Grey Mountains}. Almost twenty years ago, she rode in the back of a creaking cart as her mother — the feared Witch Hunter Captain, Gerlinde Sigloben — rode to the mining town following witch signs. But the pyres were already burning low when she arrived, and the witch was burned. Else remembers a look of satisfaction on the townsfolk’s faces. She remembers how she and her mother were encouraged to let the ashes scatter to the wind and leave. Now, twenty years later, some of those same faces — only older, and greyer — still haunt Hugeldal’s streets, and Else is suspicious.</p><h3><strong>Fresh Investigations</strong></h3><p>Investigating the sources of the witch signs establish a pattern centred on Hugeldal itself. There, the Characters meet the following townsfolk, and significant passive hostility:</p><ul><li><p>Irmegard Hugelmann is the burgomeister. Twenty years ago, her grandfather was the burgomeister, and he maintained a stranglehold over the town with the support of the real witch, and orchestrated the burning of an innocent woman to cover it up. Hugelmann is aware of her grandfather’s crimes — he confessed them to her on his deathbed, fearful for his soul, but did not name the witch — and that her position is predicated on it remaining a secret.</p></li><li><p>Waldemar Grunfeld is an aging herbalist, who, as many recall, was originally accused of witchcraft before the burnings, but managed to ‘prove’ his innocence. In truth, he is a witch, but a relatively benign, but nonetheless illegal, Hedgewitch who supports his community. He barely escaped the pyre twenty years ago and has quietly sought the other witch ever since.</p></li><li><p>Ludwig Herzog is a wealthy merchant whose rise to riches began with the witch burning of his business rival, Karina Handler, twenty years ago. Herzog was desperately in love with Handler, and regrets what happened — indeed, he used his wealth to explore necromancy to potentially bring her back, though he abandoned that quickly and locked away his books forever.</p></li><li><p>Yeomica Jungmann is the baron’s young valet. Jungmann is the ex-apprentice of the original witch, Haberman Klimmer, who was a necromancer. Yeomica murdered his master almost a decade ago, and has since pursued his own study. He also attempted to court Herzog as his apprentice, but found him an unwilling student. When he hears the Players are seeking a witch, Yeomica plots Herzog’s murder to cover his tracks.</p></li></ul><p>Lilian and Julien Nilsen are two anti-Jungfreud meddlers. They are making the investigation more difficult — creating fake witch signs in order to exacerbate tensions. Nevertheless, the Characters’ enquiries will eventually lead them to Herzog or Jungmann. When this happens, Jungmann panics and sends four @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.bestiary.T79RqnDOAQLn3I1s]{Zombie} to kill Herzog before he blabs, and another four to kill the Characters as they sleep. The next day, several townsfolk claim they heard strange noises coming from the von Jungfreud Manor. As this is investigated (the baron is not accommodating), Jungmann is with Hugelmann in the Town Hall, trying to silence her — she discovered his secret after nervously investigating the matter herself to cover her grandfather’s tracks. Her body will be found later, face frozen in terror.</p><h3><strong>The Witch Revealed!</strong></h3><p>It won’t take much to uncover the witch after this — several townsfolk spotted Jungmann at the Town Hall. Knowing he faces death, Jungmann flees for Ubersreik. He will use all of his powers to thwart the PCs, including raising the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.bestiary.GgSxlomoV220kd3G]{Ghost} of Zuriner, and the angry spirit of his old master (use a @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.bestiary.hMbcLVjk7eUdxtqC]{Cairn Wraith}) If the Characters dispatch these swiftly and reach Ubersreik docks, they find Jungmann commissioning a barge to Altdorf. Jungmann will not go down quietly, summoning as many @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.bestiary.T79RqnDOAQLn3I1s]{Zombies} as he can muster to cover his retreat. If Jungmann does escape, he will immediately plot his revenge.</p><div class=\"journal-image\"><img class=\"fit\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-starter-set/art/ash-in-the-wind.webp\" /></div>",
