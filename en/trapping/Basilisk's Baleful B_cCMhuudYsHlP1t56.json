It is a foul tasting poison, and anyone ingesting food or drink laced with Basilisk&rsquo;s Baleful Bile will be called to take an<strong> Easy (+40) Perception</strong> Test. Success indicates they detect the taint of something wrong before suﬀering the bile&rsquo;s eﬀects, but gain the @Condition[Stunned] Condition for one Round whilst they vomit it up. If ingested, the concoction inﬂicts 2 @Condition[Poisoned] Conditions, resisted with a <strong>Difficult (-10) Endurance</strong> Test. If the target fails to resist the @Condition[Poisoned] Conditions, they are permanently turned to stone.</p>",
